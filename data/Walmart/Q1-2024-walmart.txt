Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations, Walmart, Inc. 

Welcome, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today and your interest in Walmart. Joining me today from our 
home office in Bentonville are Walmart CEO, Doug McMillon; and CFO, John David Rainey. Doug and John 
David will first share their views on the quarter and then we'll open the line to your questions. During the Q&A 
portion we will be joined by our segment CEOs, John Furner, from Walmart US; Kath McLay, from Walmart 
International; and Chris Nicholas from Sam's Club. For additional detail on our results, including highlights by

a courtesy, please limit yourself to one question. 
 
Today's call is being recorded and management may make forward-looking statements. These statements are 
subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. These

C. Douglas McMillon 
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Walmart, Inc. 

Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Our team delivered a great quarter to start the year. Our results were 
stronger than we anticipated with sales growth of 5.7% and adjusted operating profit up 12.9% in constant 
currency. All three operating segments performed well. The momentum we see across the business is driven by 
growth in units sold and transaction counts as well as market share gains including general merchandise. These 
are not inflation-driven results. 
 
In the US like-for-like sales inflation was about 40 basis points for the quarter including mid-single-digit deflation in 
general merchandise and low single-digit inflation in food and consumables. Together with our suppliers we're 
making progress lowering prices. 
 
Our rollback count is up and customers are responding to our price leadership. The first highlight I'd like to call out 
is the improvement in customer experience scores. That has a lot to do with our associates.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 16-May-2024 
 
I get to visit with a lot of them as I travel. This quarter I've been in stores and clubs in Johannesburg, Cape Town, 
Toronto, Nashville, Los Angeles, Austin, Oklahoma City and Dallas. And before we get too far into the 
conversation about our performance, I want to thank all our associates everywhere. They deserve all the credit. 
They're managing the things we've always managed while simultaneously building new capabilities and driving 
change. 
 
Here's what they're doing to drive our business. First, we're providing value. Low prices on quality merchandise 
are always important to our customers and members. Our combination of everyday low prices plus a large 
number of rollbacks is resonating. During the holiday we offered a basket of Easter items with a lower price than a 
year ago in the US and Canada. Customers responded and we saw strong sell-throughs. Our merchants are 
doing a great job, including managing inventory where we finished down 2.7% globally. 
 
Second, we have the selection people are looking for. In the US, the number of marketplace sellers grew by 36% 
for the quarter with a SKU count now sitting at more than 420 million. In Mexico the number of marketplace sellers 
grew by more than 50% with SKU count up nearly 80%. More often, our customers are finding what they're 
looking for when they shop our app or site. eCommerce penetration is up in all our markets. 
 
Third, we're improving the experience of shopping with us. Our store remodels look good and are performing well 
plus our curbside pickup and delivery capabilities are improving as indicated by our customer experience metrics. 
Globally we completed nearly 70 remodels during the quarter and we're on track to do more than 900 this year. 
We're making it more convenient to shop with us, and our customers and members are rewarding us with growth 
as we save them time. 
 
We expect to continue to earn healthy levels of sales growth and simultaneously grow profit faster than sales this 
year while managing our price gaps and investing in our associates at the same time. This quarter's results were 
driven by a combination of strong core performance and the growth of our newer businesses. As it relates to the 
core, strong same-store sales growth combined with good inventory management resulted in strong profit flow 
through. 
 
In our newer businesses, advertising and membership were both up 24%. Today, we announced that we're 
expanding our data analytics and insights product, Walmart Luminate into Mexico and Canada. Our technology 
team continues to deliver the innovation that helps us drive our business. We're bringing new experiences to life 
like Generative AI driven product search that helps our customers shop more intuitively. 
 
The team continues to build and improve the platforms for marketplace and data that we're using across countries 
and they're building and improving the operating system that enables us to create a more intelligent, flexible and 
automated supply chain. The implementation of our automated storage and retrieval systems in our DCs and FCs 
is on track and we're as enthusiastic of the impact of that work as we've ever been. 
 
Turning to our segments. In Walmart US we recently announced a new private brand in food called bettergoods. 
It's our largest food private brand release in 20 years. The brand focuses on today's trends, and premium quality, 
but at the same time, 70% of bettergoods items are priced under $5. This is the type of quality and value that will 
resonate with customers across income spectrums. 
 
We also introduced on-demand early morning delivery to customer doorsteps as early as 7:00 a.m. and as quickly 
as 30 minutes. Globally, same-day delivery is available for more than 6,500 locations. In Walmart US, over the 
last 12 months, 4.4 billion items were delivered same or next day, with about 20% of those delivered in under 
three hours. Delivery times are getting faster and the cost to delivery is coming down at the same time.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 16-May-2024 
 
 
During the quarter, we made the necessary but difficult decision to close our US healthcare clinics. There were a 
number of aspects that were going well and we really want to be part of the solution to improving healthcare in 
this country. But the reality is that given reimbursement rates and cost to serve, we could no longer see a path to 
achieving an acceptable level of profitability and we're committed to being disciplined with our investments. We're 
grateful to our associates that worked in this area. They did their part. 
 
We'll continue to build our pharmacy and optical businesses and we'll find ways for our pharmacists to help as 
they've done with immunizations and vaccinations. Earlier this week we also shared decisions to eliminate some 
home office roles and reduce the amount of remote work. The vast majority of our home office associates have 
been back together in offices since we came back from the pandemic and we want to see even more of that. 
Being in person is important. 
 
Our culture is stronger when we're together. We make decisions faster, we're more creative and we help develop 
the next generation of talent. We'll continue to make changes to ensure we're best positioned to serve customers 
and support our store club and supply chain associates. 
 
Moving to Walmart International. We continue to deliver strong results with double-digit growth in sales and profit, 
lifting our company growth rates. Strength was broad based led by Walmex, China and Flipkart. 
 
Results for quarter included strong growth in eCommerce, led by store-fulfilled orders and marketplace. We saw 
improved sales growth in general merchandise categories as we focused on celebrations across the world like 
Chinese New Year, Easter and Walmart Canada's 30th Anniversary. 
 
Like the US, the International team is improving speed of delivery across markets. Same-day delivery orders in 
India grew by over 150% in the quarter and is now available across 20 major cities. One-hour delivery in China 
grew to 55 million orders as customers sought convenience during Chinese New Year. And in Chile, 60% of 
eCommerce orders are delivered same-day. 
 
With Sam's Club US, it's exciting to see how the team is using computer vision to make it faster for members 
using Scan & Go to leave the building once they're done shopping. I'm referring to the computer vision in AI-
powered exit technology that allows members to leave the club without having to stand in line to get their receipt 
checked that we announced at the consumer electronics show in January. Since then, we deployed it in about 
20% of our clubs and we're on track to have it in all US clubs by year-end. 
 
In addition to this being better for members, the technology identifies more items than we could with our previous 
process. This is a great example of people-led tech-powered solving for technology that benefits the member 
experience. It was a strong start to the year. We'll remain focused on improving customer and member 
experiences, being great merchants, building our newer businesses and improving returns. 
 
With that, I'll hand it to John David to share more about the quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

John David Rainey 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Walmart, Inc. 

Thanks, Doug. Our strong results this quarter clearly demonstrate our ability to deliver on our financial framework 
of growing operating income faster than sales. This quarter's results reflect strong execution from the team, 
across virtually every aspect of our business, share gains and improving NPS scores from our members and

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 16-May-2024 
 
customers that are increasingly looking for value and convenience, and the power of our omni retail model. I'll 
discuss our quarterly results using our framework of growth, margins and returns. 
 
We experienced ongoing sales strength with all three operating segments outperforming our expectations. We're 
growing traffic and units, and our inventories are in excellent shape. We're on a multiyear journey to reshape our 
profit profile and operating income growth trajectory and this quarter reflects the benefits of improved margins in 
our core retail operations as well as contributions from business mix. 
 
We're investing in areas that have strong capital returns like automation, store remodels and digital tools and 
technologies. Combined these investments are widening our competitive advantages, providing us levers to also 
invest in people and price, while achieving our sales and margin objectives. 
 
Before I provide more color behind the strength of our financial results, I want to remind you that there is a 
supplemental presentation on our IR website with additional information beyond my remarks. 
 
First quarter total net sales grew 5.7% on a constant currency basis, ahead of our guidance of 4% to 5% growth. 
As a reminder, the leap year this year contributes approximately 1 point to our year-over-year sales growth. 
International led the enterprise with constant currency sales growth of 10.7% reflecting strength in Walmex, China 
and Flipkart. Across markets, seasonal events were strong and we're encouraged by early improvements in 
general merchandise sales. 
 
International eCommerce sales were up 19% as we continue to expand our capabilities. In Canada, the majority 
of our marketplace growth came from items serviced by Walmart fulfillment services. In India, Flipkart same-day 
delivery became available to millions more customers as they expanded the offering to 20 cities. 
 
Walmart US also delivered better-than-expected growth with comp sales up 3.8% including strong eCommerce 
growth of 22% led by store-fulfilled pickup and delivery marketplace and advertising. Traffic and sales growth 
were strong across both stores and digital channels, and we're pleased with the unit growth. We're seeing higher 
engagement across income cohorts with upper-income households continuing to account for the majority of the 
share gains. 
 
Sam's US comp sales, ex-fuel, were also strong at 4.4%. The Sam's team continues to make progress on quality 
in-value with Member's Mark our private brand. The team is doing a great job of being on top of product trends 
with the brand. Member's Mark drove high single-digit growth in Q1 and is a growing reason why members join 
and renew alongside digitally enabled solutions such as Scan & Go and curbside pickup. 
 
Next is sales. Gross profit growth was the key driver of upside in Q1. Consolidated gross margin expanded 42 
basis points led by Walmart US. Across segments, we benefited from lower markdowns as a result of disciplined 
inventory management and favorable business mix enabling strong margin flow through from sales. 
 
Consolidated adjusted operating income grew 12.9% in constant currency, more than 700 basis points higher 
than our sales growth. This reflects better-than-expected sales growth and higher gross margins and membership 
income. This was partially offset by expense deleverage in our US segments related to higher variable pay 
expenses from our outperformance. Walmart US was the primary driver of outperformance, but all segments 
contributed to operating income growing faster than sales. 
 
Taking a closer look at margins. As we continue to work closely with our suppliers to lower cost, we're managing 
our Walmart US pricing aligned to competitive price gaps and customers are responding favorably, resulting in

sustained sales growth and higher gross margins. Our price gaps to the retail market remain strong. Improved 
inventory management and favorable business mix allowed us to optimize our pricing on everyday essentials, and 
we're investing further in value within our private brands. 
 
Our rollback program is driving customer engagement and supporting our volume growth with grocery rollback 
counts up 45% year-over-year in April. Carrying forward the success we saw last year in our seasonal programs, 
we're using celebrations and festive events to reinforce our value proposition and customers are responding. 
Chinese New Year, Valentine's Day and Easter drove stronger sales across categories including general 
merchandise. 
 
We're also working with suppliers to bring innovation to US customers while leaning into our own private brands 
as sources of value, quality and newness. As a result, we've continued to see strong momentum in private brand 
sales with grocery penetration up 30 basis points in Q1. While private brand penetration is in the low-20s as a 
percent of sales, more than half of all customer grocery baskets over the last year have had a private brand in 
them. 
 
Our inventory levels continue to come down with Walmart US declining about 4% and Sam's down nearly 5% at 
quarter-end, while we sustained strong sales and healthy in-stock rates. Having the right inventory in the right 
categories in the right places has allowed us to not only minimize markdown activity, but also support higher in-
stock levels with goods flowing more smoothly through distribution centers and to stores. Importantly, the 
business is realizing efficiencies while both customer and associate NPS scores are rising. 
 
Global eCommerce growth was 21% in Q1 and eCommerce losses continue to narrow, most notably in the US 
net delivery cost per-order, improving nearly 40%. More customers are shopping with us more often, across more 
categories, moving us along the pathway of delivery density and transaction margins that give us clear visibility 
into profitability in this channel over time. 
 
Many consumer pocketbooks are still stretched, and we see the effect of that in our business mix as they're 
spending more of their paychecks on non-discretionary categories and less on general merchandise. This 
merchandise mix remains a headwind to margins, but it's consistent with our expectations. 
 
Our Walmart US team is executing strategies to improve general merchandise sales and to increase the visibility 
of our growing eCommerce brand assortments in fashion, home and electronics. We have the opportunity to grow 
general merchandise sales in stores with our first party eCommerce assortment and especially with our 
marketplace. We were encouraged to see share gains in fashion, home and hardlines in Q1. In addition, 
marketplace sales in categories such as furniture, sporting goods, kids apparel and home grew more than 20%. 
 
In addition to sales growth and gross margin improvement, the reshaping of our profit composition is an exciting 
part of our strategy. We're enhancing capabilities in higher-margin growth drivers such as advertising, 
membership, marketplace and fulfillment, and data analytics and insights, and seeing corresponding improvement 
in our business mix. 
 
Global advertising grew 24% led by 26% growth from Walmart Connect in the US and Internationals 27% growth. 
Walmart's US ad sales reflected more than 50% growth from marketplace sellers while overall active advertiser 
counts increased nearly 19%. Sam's ad business now has 30% more active advertisers versus last year. 
 
We're pleased with the trends in our membership programs around the world. Sam's Club US reached another 
record high level for member counts and Plus Member penetration resulting in membership income growth over

13%. Sam's China member count grew 25% with increasing active and renewal rates. In addition, Walmart+ 
continued to grow double-digits as members engage with us more frequently and spend more than other 
customers. 
 
For marketplace, within International, all markets grew double-digits led by Flipkart and Walmex, reflecting the 
strength we're experiencing across markets. In the US, Walmart's marketplace delivered strong results, aided by 
36% more sellers on our platform, with 28% of sellers using our marketplace fulfillment services. 
 
To give you an example of the benefit of our omni model, in April we launched a new service enabling customers 
to order from an extended assortment of nearly 40,000 tires on our marketplace and have them installed at one of 
our 2,300 auto care centers and stores in the US. It's a great example of how we're leveraging our unique, omni 
capabilities to remove friction for customers. 
 
Within data analytics and insights, Walmart data ventures continues to see strong demand from clients for their 
insights on consumer behavior and trends and our omni-channel operations. In Q1, this business doubled versus 
last year. In April, we announced a new self-serve integration to make it easier for supplier advertisers to combine 
Walmart Luminate's insights with Walmart Connect's closed looped omni-channel retail media solutions to help 
drive product, brand, and category sales. This is the first time we're bringing these two solutions together, creating 
greater cohesion between both offerings and helping suppliers deliver more relevant shopping experiences for our 
customers. 
 
Beyond executing on our operating strategies, you're also seeing a discipline from us to address areas of our 
business that have not performed as well. You should expect this discipline to continue. Concentrating our efforts 
in capital on clear drivers of incremental value. This requires us to be bold enough to step back from areas that at 
one time, were clear opportunities or were strategically or financially accretive but now have diminishing value. 
 
It was through this lens that we made the decision to close all 51 Walmart Health centers as Doug mentioned. 
Total business reorganization cost resulted in a charge of $0.02 per share in the first quarter. 
 
Wrapping up Q1 results. Below the line items reflected slightly higher interest expense on relatively flat net debt 
balances and a lower tax rate year-over-year based on changes in the fair value of our equity investments. 
Adjusted EPS of $0.60 per share compared favorably to our guidance of $0.49 to $0.52. 
 
Turning to guidance. Our team is executing at a very high level. Q1 results exceeded our expectations for both 
sales and operating income growth. And while it might be a little much to expect every quarter to be this good, we 
feel really good about the performance and it demonstrates how this business can perform when we're firing on all 
cylinders. 
 
Consumer economic conditions have been relatively consistent since the start of the year. Many of the value-
seeking behaviors we witnessed last year have continued, particularly around seasonal events. Our focus on 
providing customers with value and convenience is resonating and we're gaining share. That said, we're one 
quarter into a year that still has some degree of uncertainty and we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. 
 
We currently expect Q2 sales to increase between 3.5% and 4.5% and for operating income growth in line with 
that at roughly 3% to 4.5%. EPS is expected to be between $0.62 and $0.65 per share. 
 
In Q2, we expect operating income growth to be impacted by timing of tech and wage investments. Combining Q1 
results, with the midpoint of our Q2 guidance, would suggest first half sales would grow nearly 5% and operating

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 16-May-2024 
 
income would grow about 8%. We feel really good about our start to the year and our outlook for the second half 
is consistent with 90 days ago. Our Q1 results and the midpoint of our Q2 guidance suggest that we should be at 
the high end or even slightly above our sales and operating income guidance for the year. 
 
We'll revisit our full year guidance as we exit Q2. This is more aligned with our historic cadence of updates and 
consistent with the philosophy we have as a management team to recognize early momentum but to also 
maintain prudence early in the year given the macro uncertainty and so much of the year is still ahead of us. 
 
In closing, I'm extremely pleased with our results this quarter. They demonstrate what our team is capable of 
when we're laser focused on the member and customer, disciplined on cost and leveraging the technology 
investments we've made. Profits are growing, customer NPS scores are increasing and we're running a great 
operation. We like our position. We like who we are and we like where we're going. 
 
We appreciate your interest in Walmart and are now ready to take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION 
 
 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kate McShane with 
Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Kate McShane 
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q 
Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking our question. We wondered if you could talk a little bit more 
about what you saw with the lower-end consumer throughout the quarter and how you think about their 
contribution to comp for the rest of the year, especially when it comes to general merchandise. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

John R. Furner 
President & Chief Executive Officer-Walmart US, Walmart, Inc. A 
Hi, Kate. It's John Furner. Good morning, I'll start. First, I'd like to say thanks to the entire team for what they did in 
the quarter and the execution. It's great to see so many of our associates making such a difference and it's also 
encouraging to see our store managers really focus on in-store merchandising in the quarter. We saw big 
improvements all across the US and that was really exciting. 
 
In terms of the consumer, it's been pretty consistent I think is the best word we would use. Consistent spending 
across income groups. We've had more growth as we mentioned in the earlier remarks and the high end 
consumer that remains true. We're very focused on value, flexibility and convenience and that's working across 
income segments. It's great to be in a position where we have store conditions that we're proud of with growth. It's 
great to be in a position where our pickup business is growing and then as we mentioned our delivery business 
has now exceeded our pickup business in size and the run rate remains strong. 
 
So I think what we can say at this point is things have been consistent. What is also helping us is in our food 
categories, broadly across the store we have almost 7,000 rollbacks that's really helping in our food categories. 
We see an even larger spread between eating at home, preparing meals at home and eating out which we think 
can help Walmart over the remainder of the year.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please 
proceed with your question. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Simeon Ari Gutman 
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q 
Good morning, everyone. I have one question I'll make it in two parts. First, to diagnose the consumer not raising 
yet, it sounds like you sort of want to but there is something holding you back besides it is early in the year but 
curious if there's anything on the consumer side? 
 
And then the second part of this is, how Doug has talked about doing both investing and then driving value today. 
And curious in this environment if you have the flexibility and even the desire to lean in even more, it looks like it 
could be a choppy year, so ability to continue to drive, to do both, driving these impressive share gains, profit 
margin expansion, while continuing to invest in the value proposition? Thanks. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

John David Rainey 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Walmart, Inc. A 
I'll start with the first part of the question, Simeon, and then hand it over to Doug for the second piece. On 
guidance, there's nothing to read into that. First, like we feel really good about the performance in the first quarter. 
These are strong results across the board. We think it's prudent to be patient on this performance and as we 
noted we'd update at the end of the second quarter. I think we'd all agree that we're in far from a certain 
environment around the consumer. It's the health of the consumer is something we read about every single day, 
and given that we're one quarter into the year, we just want to be patient on this but that should not take away 
from our conviction and the results in our team's ability to continue to execute and in our strategy that's continuing 
to drive results here. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

C. Douglas McMillon 
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Walmart, Inc. A 
Simeon, I think I'll be a bit repetitive with our previous conversations. But if you look back over the last few years, 
you'll remember that we made price investments, we made wage investments, and for a while we've been telling 
you that we think we're in pretty good shape as it relates to that. We use the term managing our price gaps 
deliberately because that's how we think about it. And if we do need to make further price investments to drive 
growth or to ensure those baskets are in good shape we can do that, investing in our associates is always part of 
our plan so I think you guys can expect that we'll continue to do it. 
 
What's happening with business mix in this quarter in particular with inventory management puts us in a position 
where we do have even more flexibility to make a variety of choices. And so, we're doing that every week and 
every month as we manage our business through the quarter and through the year.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 16-May-2024 
 
Robert F. Ohmes 
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc. Q 
Hey. Good morning and thanks for taking my one question. My question is that during the commentary, Doug and 
John David, you guys talked about deflation in both general merchandise, and in food and consumables, and then 
you talked about rollbacks in April being up 45%. And then you also talked about gross margin strength in the 
Walmart US business. Can you help us think about that going forward should we – are you – and how are you 
doing that? Is it really just the advertising, digital advertising and marketplace fulfillment and all those things are 
helping the gross margin so much, that it's more than offsetting core gross margin weakness. Maybe help us think 
about how to think about that going forward? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

C. Douglas McMillon 
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Walmart, Inc. A 
Robbie, this is Doug. I'll go first. As it relates to gross margin, we're having a conversation inside the company 
about the fact that the composition of it's changing, and we don't want to confuse people about what's happening. 
We are built, our purpose is to help people save money and live better. And we'll manage our merchandise 
margins like we always have and make sure that we're providing value. But as we report gross margin it does 
reflect newer businesses that are helping us mix things up and so we're using terms inside the company like our 
merchandise or product margins as distinguished from gross margins. 
 
So maybe, John David, as we think about our future reporting, we should help kind of clarify that a bit so that 
people don't have the wrong perception that gross margins are going up as a result of price. They're not. If you 
look at rollbacks for example, as John mentioned in the US, as we mentioned earlier this morning, we're seeing a 
lot of rollbacks. And suppliers participate in a majority of those but not all of them. We're going to lead on price 
and we're going to manage our margins and we're going to be the Walmart that we've always been, but it is also 
great news that the business mix is changing, which does change gross margin performance. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

John David Rainey 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Walmart, Inc. A 
Robbie, there's maybe three points that I'd make in response to your question. The first is that overall inflation 
level for the business was up about 40 basis points for the quarter. That's half the rate of increase that we saw 
last year, so we're driving this revenue growth through more units, more foot traffic in-stores and feel really good 
about that and it shows that we're just becoming more relevant with consumers, so that's the first point. 
 
Second point around gross margins is we've mentioned several times that inventory is in a much better place. 
One of the consequences or results of that is we see a lot less markdowns in our business and so that drove 
some of the improvement in the first quarter. 
 
The third point and the one I'd want to emphasize the most here. If you look at the composition of our operating 
income improvement year-over-year, roughly $900 million, about one-third of that came from our newer 
businesses like advertising, membership, data ventures, and we're quite excited about that, but combined with 
that we're seeing improved eCommerce losses, and one of the things that I focus a lot on in our business is, what 
is the incremental profit from that additional revenue that we have each year. So incremental margins, and if you 
just focused on our eCommerce business, in this last quarter the incremental margins around that business were 
12.5%, so think about that. Roughly 3 times our overall margin. 
 
There's not, to me, a more compelling data point that supports the strategy that we have and our execution 
around that and importantly, how that's changing the margin profile of our business going forward.

Operator: Our next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Michael Lasser 
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC Q 
Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. As hard as it is to mention, how would you break down 
the factors that are driving Walmart's business that are related to its actions and strategies versus those factors 
that are more of a function of the environment, such as high inflation and the moderating labor market. What two 
or three metrics is Walmart monitoring to internally gauge this? 
 
Obviously, the point of the question is trying to understand not only the sustainability of the performance if the 
macro does get better but also the prospect that the outperformance could expand if the environment weakens. 
Thank you so much. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

C. Douglas McMillon 
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Walmart, Inc. A 
Michael, I'd probably ignore the external environment more than you do. I mean, we are focused on what we're 
doing and how we earn business with customers and members, and if you look at what's happened, we've been 
known for price forever but we're increasingly known for convenience, so whether the environment is inflationary 
or deflationary, whether customers have more money or less money, if we're doing a good job on the items and 
prices and the service we provide, saving them money with pickup and delivery for example, we can continue to 
grow share. 
 
So we're merchants at the core and we've added through the technological changes that we've made and the 
service changes that we've made, the dimension to the business that's driving that growth. I don't know what the 
future looks like in terms of what pricing is going to look like a year out, two years out and I don't really worry 
about that very much. I worry about our own execution. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

John David Rainey 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Walmart, Inc. A 
Not much to add there, but I think the results this quarter are really a reflection of execution across the team. 
We're laser focused on the things that matter most to our customers and one data point that I'd share just in the 
US business and John might want to chime in on this, but you know, Michael, that we grade ourselves by a 
perfect order and what a perfect order is for us is when you come to our virtual store online, do you find the things 
that you want? Do we have to replace those? Is it delivered when we say it will be delivered? 
 
Year-over-year in the first quarter, we saw an almost 900-basis-point improvement in our perfect order scores. To 
me that's a great example of how the team is continuing to execute and this is resonating with customers. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

John R. Furner 
President & Chief Executive Officer-Walmart US, Walmart, Inc. A 
Hey, Michael. Good morning. It's John. I'd say something similar to what Doug said. We're always focused on 
value and over the last few years we've been talking about flexibility and the ability to be convenient whether a

customer wants to shop at the counter, at the curb, or delivery and it's been exciting to see just these last few 
months that delivery is now exceeding other channels, which is great, which gives the customer a lot of optionality 
and then the number that Doug mentioned earlier, 4.4 billion units delivered same day, next day, is exciting and 
it's growing quickly, and as he also mentioned, about 20% of that is sub-three hours and we've expanded that 
service earlier in the morning, later at night, so we're becoming even more convenient for individuals, for shoppers 
and families in terms of being able to serve all of their needs. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

C. Douglas McMillon 
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Walmart, Inc. A 
Those underlying input metrics we're focused on around the world in our Sam's US business and international 
and the commonality between the strategies first party eCommerce, marketplace, advertising, membership, 
causes us to increasingly be thinking about the same thing as we build these new businesses. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Kathryn J. McLay 
President & Chief Executive Officer, Walmart International, Walmart, Inc. A 
Yeah, I mean, I would just add in, Mike. You look in Chile, it's probably a market that's had the least amount of 
growth, the economy has been tough there, as we focused on input metrics like NPS, in-stock, our price 
perception, price gap, market share, if you focus on those things, when the economy starts to recover, the 
business lifts with it. 
 
While we're doing that you're also getting in and making sure that you're building out more sustainable businesses 
around eCommerce, so over 60% of our eCommerce orders are same day in Chile now, so I think we have 
shown that we can prosper and thrive in kind of multiple different versions of how the economy plays out across 
the world, and I think during this time, as we're focused on building out our eCommerce omni business we're 
being more and more relevant to consumers in different markets. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Chris Nicholas 
President & Chief Executive Officer, Sam's Club, Walmart, Inc. A 
I think for Sam's Club, it's very similar. We have a really balanced results in Sam's Club and as John mentioned, 
it's all in the hands of the associates and the hard work that they did, but the value proposition is really resonating 
with the club model. It's great items at great value and we'll just never relent on that and members are thanking us 
for it. 
 
So, Plus membership – membership is an all-time high, Plus membership is at 54% of our member base right 
now and is up 330 basis points in the year. Why? Because we're focusing on the things that really matter. 
Deepening digital engagement with our members, 18% eCommerce growth and a third of our members are using 
Scan & Go now which is really exciting. 
 
We're enhancing our member value proposition constantly. Price is part of it, but value is an important component 
too. I think you've all heard that we've got 120 of our stores of our clubs today that have got the new exit 
technology that's powered by AI and computer vision that's really exciting. And then Member's Mark which is our 
own brand is really setting the bar for quality as well as value. It's now over a third of our sales and we are seeing 
really strong participation in the quarter, so people just want really great items at really great value and we just 
continue to give them that.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 16-May-2024 
 
Krisztina Katai 
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q 
Hi. Good morning, and congrats on a great quarter. So, Kath, I wanted to ask you on international opportunities in 
particular. The performance is really strong. I think you put up your best operating margin in over six years. So 
can you talk about sort of the main drivers behind the improvement? Just how you're thinking about international 
EBIT structure on a go forward basis as you have, alternative value streams that are ramping, eCommerce 
contribution is improving, all regions are posting very strong topline growth. 
 
And I just wanted to ask if there's anything you can share regarding Flipkart's contribution. How has that changed 
relative to the acquisition as we've been reading reports that at one point you're ramping up for an IPO? Thank 
you. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Kathryn J. McLay 
President & Chief Executive Officer, Walmart International, Walmart, Inc. A 
Yeah, thanks for the question and there's quite a few components to that. I'll try and take them in chunks. First of 
all, I want to recognize all of our associates in international for the extraordinary strong result that we've been able 
to deliver over the last period. You're right. It is a really strong result. Top line was up 10.7%. Bottom line for op 
inc was up 27%. Now I would like to call out that that's not – that's kind of extraordinary. There was some one-offs 
that went into Q1 op inc which aren't repeatable, but we are holding to the ratio of bottom line growing faster than 
top line. 
 
So we see strength in international, particularly in the way that we are turning up as kind of more of an 
ecosystem. So if you look in Walmex, while we have grown the traditional business, we've been looking at how 
we make sure we're relevant to consumers in areas like where we had consumers that couldn't engage with us 
online, we've been able to provide a service that enables them to get digital connectivity. And what that means is 
that, we now have different revenue streams coming in. I think we have over 13 million customers have engaged 
with us on [ph] Byte (00:39:48) which is our digital connectivity. We've sold a number of health memberships, so 
the composition of that business as well as having our [ph] cashy (00:39:58) financial services looks different and 
that's helping drive the different kind of economics and more richer op inc. 
 
As we look at then at eCom across the globe, I'll probably call out China. I know I've called out the China market 
before, but really strong growth in Sam's Club and that business is almost 50-50 offline and online, and while 
we're doing that, I think this quarter, our bottom line grew faster than our top line in Sam's Club, so really good 
strength because they worked at a model of dark stores that give them access to a larger addressable area of the 
market, and allow them to deliver really, really efficiently. So our eCom omni business is growing in a sustainable 
way. 
 
And then as you talk about Flipkart, I think the things that we've seen with Flipkart that we really like is as their 
business has grown, we've seen Myntra get to EBITDA positive for the last two quarters. We've seen a growth in 
some premiumization and all of that is lifting kind of the profile of the Flipkart business. And so they're on track to 
the growth trajectory that we had them on and we are looking and exploring when will be the right time to IPO that 
business, but now there's the strong growth in Flipkart and in PhonePe and we're excited about the India market.

Operator: Our next question is from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Oliver Chen 
Analyst, TD Cowen Q 
Hi. Thank you. Within general merchandise, what categories are you most excited about? What do you see 
happening with innovation opportunities and/or opportunities for improvement? And as we think about general 
merchandise as well, the intersection of artificial intelligence, large language models and also really changing the 
way consumers think about shopping, just what's on your mind for enhancing that, and embracing the 
marketplace as you've been doing to continue to elevate the brand? Thank you. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Chris Nicholas 
President & Chief Executive Officer, Sam's Club, Walmart, Inc. A 
General merchandise is a really core part of all of our businesses and it's something in Sam's Club that we're 
really excited about. We have brands that are extreme value and we feel really good about that, and we've got 
Member's Mark where we have incredible value and quality. And what we're seeing is the members are opting 
into those as a brand and renewing membership with us because we offer such high-quality at such high-value. 
So what we're seeing is that people are continuing to opt into us. Our units are running ahead of our sales on 
general merchandise because of the value, so we feel really bullish. You think about apparel, jewelry, home, 
hardlines, auto, consumer electronics. We're seeing really strong unit growth in there, and it's just been 
[indiscernible] (00:43:07) because of value and it's because of innovation, so we remain really bullish in that 
space. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

John R. Furner 
President & Chief Executive Officer-Walmart US, Walmart, Inc. A 
Hey, Oliver, it's John. Good morning. I'd like to talk about a couple of things in GM, and I think I'd first start with 
eCommerce, the strong performance at 22% growth is very helpful. We've picked up momentum in the 
marketplace, really, really pleased to see a number – a really large number of new sellers come on board and 
assortments well north of 400 million. 
 
We spend a lot of time talking about our customer experience score which starts with the top of the funnel and 
then we work our way all the way down to conversion and as John David mentioned earlier, one of the 
components is perfect order. And as you look through results, it's exciting to see more customers shopping more 
often, particularly in the marketplace and then the categories that are really strong that are standing out is apparel 
and fashion online. 
 
I'm really excited about what's happening in men's and women's and kid's apparel. We've seen growth there and 
then our hardlines business has been strong over the quarter. It was helpful in the quarter to have Easter early 
and strong weather in March that gave us a strong early start, and these businesses we call omni services like tire 
installation as we mentioned earlier, having your prescription ready via ordering online or cake decorating, these 
are all great services that are relatively unique to Walmart to be able to enable those from a digital standpoint all 
the way through the store, and then delivered to people's homes. So I really am excited about the convenience 
and the expansion and assortment that we're offering. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

C. Douglas McMillon 
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Walmart, Inc. A 
Oliver, we punch below our weight on general merchandise specifically in apparel and home for really a long time, 
maybe forever, and I think the progress that we're seeing now is driven by the in-store remodels and eCommerce.

The marketplace is a great opportunity but 1P will be important too, so we've now got tools that we can use to 
grow the general merchandise business that didn't have before. 
 
As it relates to the other part of your question, I think the thing worth mentioning is the progress we're seeing on 
search. I'm really excited about a solution-oriented search and this migration that many of us are on trying to 
create a personal assistant, so we can be more anticipatory, save people more time and help them with solutions 
more than what our previous search capability could do. So, I think that's going to be on a maturity curve from 
now until the end of time. And generative AI has helped us step-change that and I expect that that improvement 
will continue.

Operator: Our next question is from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Seth Sigman 
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Q 
Hey. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to focus on operating expenses and thinking about the investments 
planned for this year. If I recall there was a first half weighting in the guidance originally. I know some of that was 
a year-over-year dynamic. Any update on how to think about that and more specific to the second quarter. It looks 
like you setup guidance very similar to how you setup Q1. I'm just curious, is there anything different about the 
opportunity in Q2? In other words could there be a bigger step-up in spending or anything else that may limit the 
flow through that we were able to see here? Thanks. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

John David Rainey 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Walmart, Inc. A 
Sure, Seth. Happy to take the question. This is John David. So, when we gave guidance at the beginning of the 
year in last quarter's call, we talked about the first half of the year. We'd likely see that sales would outpace 
operating income. Maybe that's unlikely now with these results in the first quarter, but we did have some planned 
investment in the second quarter related to some technology investments. We've also got a little higher 
depreciation year-over-year. 
 
In terms of the opportunity in the second quarter relative to the first quarter, there are a couple things I want to call 
out in the first quarter that likely would not repeat themselves, but I don't want to take away from the team's strong 
performance. The first of those is just strong seasonal events in international that helped us. And we also lapped 
a LIFO charge last year at Sam's, which contributed to some of the operating income growth. Those are likely not 
to repeat themselves, so the possibility for outperformance in 2Q may be less than what it was in the first quarter. 
 
That said, I don't want to take away the headline here and we feel really good about how the team's operating. 
Feel really good about what the year holds for us and the opportunity to outperform the guidance that we've given. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Seth Sigman

Operator: Our next question is from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your 
question. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Kelly Bania 
Analyst, BMO Capital Markets Corp. Q 
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. Wanted to just go back to business mix, I guess, with the 
continued strong growth in marketplace. I guess when you look at the performance of general merchandise in 
Walmart US, that marketplace sales would obviously skew higher towards those discretionary categories, you 
noted the 420 million SKUs there. So, I guess the question is, is the impact of 3P marketplace growth at all 
starting to cannibalize maybe in a good way the general merchandise comps that you provide, or would the 
performance of general merchandise be stronger if you looked at it more holistically from a total GMB standpoint? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

John David Rainey 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Walmart, Inc. A 
Let me start on this and others may want to jump in. So first of all, as you think about the mix of our business, 
we've continued to have a headwind as consumer wallets have been stretched. And for us, that's resulted in 
about 100-basis point shift away from general merchandise to other categories of our business in the first quarter. 
We expect that to continue or some magnitude of that for the balance of the year. 
 
But to me, the real story here around general merchandise is the progress that we're making in our marketplace. 
And so while general merchandise is call it roughly flat, there are categories like pets and beauty, where the 
growth in the marketplace is in excess of 30%. There are other categories like furniture, sporting goods, that are 
in excess of 20%. And I think this shows that consumers or customers are coming to us thinking of us very 
differently than what they have in the past. And it's also an indication of how and where we're gaining share in our 
business. So general merchandise being able to offer third-party assortment is giving our customers a lot more 
options than what they've had in the past. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

C. Douglas McMillon 
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Walmart, Inc. A 
I think general merchandise mix was impacted by food inflation to a degree. When food shot up to mid-double-
digits, there were a lot of customers that had their paycheck allocated that direction. And now that food pricing 
has calmed down some and we've got rollbacks happening in food and you've got a deflationary situation with 
GM, you've got the opportunity given elasticity to grow more units which we're doing. And the fact that we're 
growing share feels good. So, I don't get too caught up, Kelly, on whether the sales come through stores, clubs, 
first party, or marketplace. We just want to have what people are looking for. And we'll manage the mix on the 
other end of it in a way that generates more profitability, which is what you're seeing in this quarter.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 16-May-2024 
 
Hey. Thank you, guys. You mentioned that within Walmart US, your share gains were led by the higher-income 
households I believe. Curious how you define that? What percent of your customer base the higher-income 
households comprise and how are you targeting that consumer? And also curious, how that consumers' 
engagement with Walmart changed? Thanks. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

John David Rainey 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Walmart, Inc. A 
Yeah, this is John David. I'll start. So we define where we stratify the income groups roughly as $50,000 and 
below, $50,000 to $100,000, and then $100,000 and above. And as a general rule, our customer base breaks 
down about one-third in each group. And so in terms of what we're doing to be more attractive to that higher-
income household, I think this is really the story or the word we've been using here is convenience. 
 
We are not just a play for value anymore. We talked about the number of units that we've shipped in the last 12 
month which is on par with any eCommerce player in the world. That shows that customers are coming to us and 
we're a consideration where we haven't been before. And convenience matters to someone irrespective of what 
your paycheck is, irrespective of what your income level is and we expect that to be durable. We don't expect that 
to change. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

John R. Furner 
President & Chief Executive Officer-Walmart US, Walmart, Inc. A 
Yeah, John David, I'd just add to that. It's also been encouraging to see the improvements in fresh food. We've 
definitely experienced benefit from improvements in quality, the supply chain has gotten tighter, many of you have 
seen the work we're doing in supply chain, but produce has been really exciting to see the progress over the last 
couple years. The same sort of quality improvements are coming through in the meat department. And you can 
see that in the types of items and categories that we're selling in-store and those in pickup & delivery. And in the 
delivery business, where we're stronger with higher-income consumer, that's where we've seen a lot of growth. 
 
I'm really excited, Doug, what you mentioned earlier is better goods as being a way to sell better quality, better 
taste profiles and at values that really matter. 70% of the items under $5 is exciting and that appeals to all income 
groups. And so if you're trying to feed a family of four or five or six and prices in restaurants have gone up in 
Walmart and it's beginning to come down. And we're really proud of the rollbacks. I think our value message is 
strong and having the ability to deliver flexibly is going to work out really well for us. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

C. Douglas McMillon 
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Walmart, Inc. A 
We're not trying to chase higher-income cohort sales. We just offer value. If you look at what's happened 
historically, people with higher incomes have shopped Walmart. They've just been selective in the categories that 
they buy and the items that they buy. So, if we offer them the right items at the right prices whether that's in-store, 
first party or marketplace, they'll respond to that. And so as we've been able to expand our assortment online, we 
can appeal to more people and then you layer on the convenience dimension and you get a good outcome.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call 16-May-2024 
 
Chuck Grom 
Analyst, Gordon Haskett Research Advisors Q 
Yeah, thanks. Good morning. Congrats on a really great quarter. Just wondering if you can discuss trends you're 
seeing within general merchandise between smaller ticket, shorter replacement items versus higher ticket longer 
replacement items. And if any shifts in spending within the categories reflect anything about whether the 
consumer is making any incremental changes in their discretionary spending? And then just as a quick follow up, 
just curious if there's any deviation or big change in trend throughout the quarter by month. Thank you. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

John R. Furner 
President & Chief Executive Officer-Walmart US, Walmart, Inc. A 
Yeah, Chuck, good morning. It's John. I'll take it. I think the best way to describe the consumer is, it has been 
remarkably consistent over the last couple years. Mix has changed but it hasn't changed that much. We've seen 
growth in both brands and private brands. We have seen a wide range of price point selling in the quarter. March 
was a strong month, given Easter was in the month. We had leap year in February that was also helped to make 
it stronger. So the phasing of the quarter wasn't all that surprising. It was strong in February, strong again in 
March, weather was favorable in March, a little bit colder and then April was softer without Easter in it. But we 
walked out of the quarter into the month of May with similar trends that we've been seeing. So, the phasing of the 
quarter wasn't all that different than we expected. 
 
I think you should look forward, the consumer is consistent, our inventory is in good shape, our merchants, we 
said this a few minutes ago, they have the ability to mix out, they're managing their price gaps and value, they're 
managing additional margins, their markdowns have been lower due to stronger inventory management, a little bit 
of improvement this year in shrinkage from the previous years. We've been going up for the last three years and 
it's good to see that's starting to come down in some places in the country, but we'll mix this out. Our merchant 
team, they've done this for a while and in any situation with a consumer we want to focus on value and be there 
for them and we'll manage the mix on the back side.

with your question.

Rupesh Parikh 
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Q 
Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Also, congrats on a nice quarter. So just going back to the 
commentary on Walmart+. It sounds like it's growing double digits. As we look at the backdrop out there for 
membership and subscriptions, you're clearly seeing a more crowded landscape. So, just want to get a sense of 
how you guys feel about the value proposition today and then further opportunities to differentiate Walmart+ going 
forward. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

John R. Furner 
President & Chief Executive Officer-Walmart US, Walmart, Inc. A 
Hi, Rupesh. It's John. Pleased with the progress in Walmart+. It is an important part of what we do. And it is a 
great way for customers to save time and save money by joining Walmart+. You get access to unlimited deliveries

which is great and I talked to a lot of people over the country that use it all the time. It's also been important for us 
to improve the perfect order as we mentioned earlier. We launched Walmart+ in 2020 at a time when the supply 
chain was difficult. And so the continued momentum in improvements and being able to fulfill customer's orders 
with what they ordered when they ordered has been important. But again it's an important part of what we do. We 
think it's a great solution for customers and it's been exciting to see the progress.

Operator: Our next question is from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your 
question. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Gregory Scott Melich 
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC Q 
Thanks. I'd like to pivot a bit back to the top line. And I think you said inflation was 40 bps in the quarter. If you 
look at your guidance for the rest of the year, do you expect it to settle at that kind of low level or even fall further? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

John David Rainey 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Walmart, Inc. A 
Greg, we expect it to be relatively close to what we saw in the current quarter. It's a mix across the baskets. 
We've seen general merchandise be more deflationary, but consumables and food are hovering slightly above 
flat-to-up 1, so we generally expect it to be in this level. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Gregory Scott Melich 
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC Q 
Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I'll turn the 
call over to Doug McMillon for closing remarks. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

C. Douglas McMillon 
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Walmart, Inc. 

Thank you all for joining the call. Again, thanks for our associates for a really strong quarter. When I think about 
the headlines for the quarter what goes through my mind is first the eCommerce growth. I think the progress we're 
making on convenience for customers is a big deal. And that's happening through our store fulfillment as well as 
through fulfillment centers, the marketplace is growing and that brings along with it growth and advertising and 
membership. It was great to see both of those up 24%. Second headline is related really good inventory 
management and the third headlines related to pricing. I think the number of rollbacks that we have and the value 
that we're offering to customers and members is resonating and those really set this quarter apart. 
 
Big picture, our thought is the same as it has been. We're going to be able to grow sales because we're 
positioned to serve people how they want to be served. We're going to grow profit faster than sales because of 
business mix and we're going to be able to grow returns as we make the right capital investments. So, we'll be 
really consistent as it relates to that through the year, and we appreciate your time and attention.
