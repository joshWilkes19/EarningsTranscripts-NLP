C. Douglas McMillon 
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Walmart, Inc. 

Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Our associates delivered another strong quarter, continuing our 
momentum. They're working hard to save our customers and members' time and money while simultaneously 
transforming our business for the future. For the quarter, sales grew 6.1% in constant currency, and profit was up 
9.8%. 
 
Globally, we drove strong growth in e-commerce, up 27%. Advertising grew 28%, and membership income was 
up 22%. This helped us grow profits faster than sales even as we work to help lower prices and invest in our 
associates. The rapid growth from these newer businesses is helping us strengthen our business model.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 19-Nov-2024 
 
All three segments of our business performed well. Sales for Walmart International grew 12.4% in constant 
currency. Comp sales for Sam's Club US were 7%, and Walmart US delivered comp sales of 5.3%. 
 
Transaction counts and unit volumes were positive across each segment, and we continue to gain market share 
in the US, both in grocery and general merchandise. Households earning more than $100,000 made up 75% of 
our share gains. In the US, in-store volumes grew, curbside pickup grew faster and delivery sales grew even 
faster than that. 
 
Becoming more convenient for our customers and members is helping drive our growth. We had almost no like-
for-like inflation in the US this quarter. It was nice to see general merchandise grow low-single-digits in the US, 
even as prices are deflated by over 4%. 
 
We currently have about 6,000 rollbacks in Walmart US across all categories. We're feeling some margin 
pressure from growth in GLP-1 drugs, so we're pleased to see general merchandise sales be positive. 
 
Across the company, inventory is in very good shape. The unique characteristics of this quarter included a US 
port strike, two large hurricanes and the flooding they caused. Our team did a really nice job preparing before 
those events. And they worked hard to aid recovery after the storms. 
 
The team that comes together from across the company to form our emergency operations center is impressive. 
They coordinate closely with federal, state and local leaders. They make sure our associates are accounted for 
and safe. 
 
And we set up distribution points at stores in the affected areas where we serve hot meals, give away supplies, 
offer showers, laundry services, and phone charging. 
 
Through Walmart and the Walmart Foundation, we made a $16 million commitment, which we've delivered on. 
This includes 178 truckloads of needed supplies and cash grants totaling nearly $10 million to support local 
needs. 
 
Our truck drivers and other associates helped facilitate or serve 544,000 meals in the affected areas, supported 
by our non-profit partners. Our customers and members contributed an additional $14.5 million from in-store and 
online campaigns. 
 
I got a chance to see our associates in action in Georgia and here in Bentonville, and I couldn't be prouder of 
them all. In total, the storms and the port strike lifted our sales growth by a small amount, and negatively affected 
operating income growth by a larger amount. 
 
The takeaway should be that we delivered on our financial framework, despite the noise from these events. This 
was clearly a strong quarter. And the changes we've been working on for years are continuing to bear fruit. We're 
well positioned to serve people how they want to be served, whether that's coming into a store, picking up an 
order or having it delivered. 
 
Our team has changed, developed new capabilities and learned how to work in new ways. We build new tech 
more effectively than we used to. And we're doing it with more speed. This is a more customer and member-
centric organization.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 19-Nov-2024 
 
I got to attend our Sam's Club grand opening in Grapevine, Texas a few weeks ago, and it was exciting to be 
there. We made quite a few changes to the design of this club. We have an expanded area for curbside pickup 
and delivery orders, new category adjacencies with consumables near the pickup and delivery staging area, and 
a stronger general merchandise presentation that has improved the sales mix of those categories. 
 
Boldly, our Sam's team also eliminated traditional checkouts. So our members can use Scan & Go and the new 
computer vision exit technology to exit the club faster. Just imagine a 150,000 square foot Sam's Club, with no 
traditional checkouts. 
 
The week after that grand opening in Texas, I made a trip to China. The week before I arrived, we opened our 
50th Sam's Club there, with 60,000 members. All 50 clubs are performing well, and we have more to come. 
 
About half our sales in China are digital, thanks in-part to our network of over 350 club distribution points, which 
provide one-hour delivery service to members, extending the reach of our traditional clubs. 
 
We've learned a lot from operating around the world. And we continue to learn from places like China where 
social commerce, including live-streaming, are growing quickly, and places like India, where financial services 
have digitized, at scale. 
 
Last week, I got to spend a couple of days with our team in Mexico, where our team is driving innovation in lots of 
areas, including with: our cellular service, BAIT; our Financial Services business, Cashi; and with healthcare 
services, where we've helped over 400,000 customers visit a doctor in our in-store healthcare clinics. 
 
As in other markets, our Walmex team is growing e-commerce, adding newer businesses, including marketplace 
and advertising, and becoming an omnichannel retailer. As I mentioned last quarter, we're seeing early tangible 
results from the deployment of generative AI. 
 
I'm a little hesitant to talk about AI, because I know someone will hear this in the months and years to come and 
chuckle about how old school it sounds, given how fast things are changing. But it's important to convey that 
we're learning and applying generative AI, AI, and machine learning to solve the practical opportunities right in 
front of us. 
 
Our data sets are valuable, and we're learning to put them to work to improve the customer and member 
experience and assist our associates as they do their daily work. I'll build on the example I shared last quarter 
about how Gen AI has helped us improve our product catalog by mentioning the personal shopping assistant 
we're building. We've had it in beta form for five months, and it continues to improve. 
 
I'm excited about how it will improve the customer experience in the months and years to come, enabling us to 
provide a better experience than the one that starts by typing into a search bar and getting a list of results to 
choose from. We're racing to improve all the things that people love about shopping and remove or diminish all 
the things they don't. 
 
In addition to the customer-facing work, 15 months ago, we deployed a Gen AI tool to all of our US home office 
associates. It's called My Assistant. We've expanded access to home office associates in 13 additional countries, 
and we continue to see engagement grow. It provides our associates a place to access knowledge and time-
saving actions in a secure environment. Since launch, 50,000 associates have used My Assistant to ask 1.5 
million questions.

Our leaders can get insights into people-related metrics, such as hiring and retention, and associates can get 
answers to common policy questions, like how do I order my discount card, through a conversational experience. 
We'll continue to build on these use cases to enable more productivity and help identify the next best task for our 
associates in stores and clubs. 
 
Just as we're enhancing the customer experience with Gen AI, we're working to remove friction for our associates 
so they can do high-value work that they enjoy, like serving our customers and being merchants. I continue to be 
excited about how our associates are learning and changing the way they think and work. 
 
With that, I'll wrap up and turn it over to our CFO, whose Baylor Bears beat my Arkansas Razorbacks in 
basketball recently. We'll see you in March, John David. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

John David Rainey 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Walmart, Inc. 

Well, we look forward to that, Doug. I hope the Razorbacks have a good season, just not as good as the Bears. 
 
I want to start by thanking our team for delivering another strong quarter. We're encouraged by the steady 
momentum building across the business. Importantly, the drivers of our outperformance are similar to the past 
several quarters, with customers and members continuing to respond to our value proposition as we provide 
lower prices and greater levels of convenience. 
 
We're broadening our assortment, improving customer experience and earning their trust while seeing share 
gains as a result. We're also realizing benefits from the investments we've made in our core omni-retail business 
and seeing improved profitability with newer businesses. We're executing on our strategy and the business model 
is delivering as it's designed to do, with operating income growing faster than sales. And yet, there is much more 
opportunity ahead. 
 
As Doug noted, the hurricanes that impacted the Southeastern United States resulted in unanticipated expenses 
during the quarter. I'm incredibly proud of how our team responded to support the communities that we serve 
using our fleet of semi-trucks, supply chain, logistics capabilities, product inventory and financial resources to 
support the restoration effort. 
 
At the peak of the storms, we had about 400 stores, clubs and DCs closed. We're pleased that all of our 
associates in the affected areas remain safe, and we continue to support them during this disruptive period. 
We've since reopened all of our supercenters except for two that were extensively damaged, and we're in the 
process of restoring these stores to serve customers again as soon as possible. 
 
Now let me review the highlights of our financial results. Q3 sales, operating income and EPS all exceeded the 
top end of our guided ranges. Enterprise net sales growth was over 6% on a constant currency basis, with all 
three operating segments outperforming our expectations, aided by strong e-commerce growth. 
 
Walmart US comp sales increased 5.3%, including e-commerce sales growth of 22%. Growth in customer 
transactions and units across stores and e-commerce remains strong. Store fulfilled delivery increased nearly 
50% and surpassed $2.5 billion monthly run rate. We've now had 12 consecutive months of deliveries above $2 
billion. 
 
Food categories were especially strong this quarter with unit volumes growing by the highest level in four years. 
We also generated mid-teens growth in health and wellness due largely to branded pharmacy scripts, including

GLP-1. GLP-1 sales contributed about one point to the segment comp, while continuing to create mix pressures in 
gross profit. We're encouraged by the improvement in general merchandise, where we had low single-digit comp 
sales growth, including strength in home, hardline and toys. 
 
US customers remain resilient with behaviors largely consistent over the past four quarters to six quarters. They 
continue to seek value to maximize their budgets while also choosing convenient options to save time. 
 
Our efforts to bring down pricing have helped as total like-for-like inflation has remained close to flat for the past 
four quarters with Q3 general merchandise and consumables deflationary and food inflationary in the low single-
digits. 
 
We're seeing higher engagement across income cohorts with upper income households continuing to account for 
the majority of our share gains. Our international business had another strong quarter with constant currency 
sales growth of 12.4%, reflecting strength in Flipkart, Walmex in China. We saw positive unit growth across 
markets with sales strength in both general merchandise and food and consumables. 
 
E-commerce sales increased 43%, and penetration grew across all markets with speed of delivery becoming 
increasingly important to customers. In the last 12 months, International delivered over 2.1 billion items same day 
or next day with about 45% of those delivered in under one hour. 
 
Flipkart's BBD or Big Billion Day sales event was up double-digits in both top-line and customer growth. The 
timing of the event was earlier than last year, benefiting our year-over-year sales comparisons in Q3 with a 
corresponding headwind expected in Q4. 
 
Walmex growth outpaced the comparable market for the sixth consecutive quarter, and our business in China 
continued to grow double digits with strength in Sam's Club and e-commerce. PhonePe also had a good quarter 
with monthly transactions surpassing $8.7 billion and total annualized payment volume of approximately $1.6 
trillion. 
 
Sam's Club US comp sales ex-fuel increased 7%, including e-commerce growth of 26% with increased 
transactions and unit volumes accounting for almost the entirety of the comp growth. In response to member 
feedback, Sam's rolled out new perks in August, like Express Delivery and the elimination of curbside pickup fees 
for Club tier members, which helped e-commerce growth. Since that launch, e-commerce growth has increased 
by more than 700 basis points versus our trends in the first half of the year with club fulfilled delivery more than 
doubling in that period. 
 
The convenience Sam's provides both inside the club and via e-commerce is a differentiator in the warehouse 
club channel. Scan & Go penetration of sales increased more than 250 basis points. And the nearly completed 
rollout of our Just Go exit technology across all 600 clubs is enabling about 70% members to exit without a check. 
Members love it with member satisfaction scores on exit now close to 90. 
 
Our frictionless approach to serving members by leveraging technology is on full display at our new club opened 
in Grapevine, Texas, the first of 30 new clubs we expect to open in the coming years. If you're in the area, we'd 
encourage you to check it out. 
 
From a margin standpoint, consolidated gross margin expanded 21 basis points, led by Walmart US with 
international results pressured by the timing of Flipkart's BBD sales event. In the US, improved margins reflected 
strong inventory management again this quarter with a 0.6% decline on more than 5% sales growth, as well as a

lower level of markdowns that has allowed us to manage pricing aligned to competitive price gaps, providing 
everyday low prices for our customers and members remains a priority, and we continue to lower prices in the US 
across our assortment of national brands and private brands. 
 
During the quarter, we had price rollbacks on approximately 6,000 items across our assortment, including around 
3,000 items in grocery, and have converted nearly 2,000 price rollbacks over the past year to long-term price 
reductions. We're pleased with how customers and members are responding to our strong value proposition. 
 
As our business model evolves, it's encouraging to see our margins improve from a diverse set of offerings. 
Global e-commerce losses continued to narrow in Q3, most notably in Walmart US. While improved business mix 
helped, we're seeing good progress in core e-commerce margins. There are a few key factors driving this 
improvement, delivery densification, increased penetration of paid expedited delivery orders and the automation 
of our supply chain. 
 
As we scale our store fulfilled delivery business and expand our catchment areas, we've seen significant 
improvement in batch density with orders per delivery up 20%. In addition, the popularity of expedited delivery has 
resulted in more than 30% of orders coming from customers and members that elected to pay a convenience fee 
to receive their delivery in less than one hour or less than three hours. 
 
And lastly, we continue to make progress and the automation of our supply chain is now more than 50% of our 
fulfillment center volume is automated, which is twice as much at this point last year. This has the obvious benefit 
of lowering the per unit cost of delivery. These factors contributed to the third consecutive quarter of 
approximately 40% reduction in US net delivery cost per order. 
 
Importantly, while we drive greater efficiency, we're enhancing service levels with customer NPS for delivery 
reaching all-time highs this quarter. We're also continuing to reshape our profit composition and business mix as 
we scale growth drivers such as advertising, membership, marketplace and fulfillment and data analytics and 
insights. 
 
Our global advertising business increased 28% in Q3, driven by 50% growth in international, led by Flipkart, which 
was aided by the BBD event, as well as another strong quarter from Walmart Connect in the US, which grew 
26%. We're building a highly unique retail media platform and have been encouraged by ongoing tests showing 
customer receptivity to growth in digital ads, especially where ads help customers discover relevant items that are 
trending, navigate and compare choices and enjoy Walmart's everyday low prices. We're also pleased with the 
trends in our membership programs. 
 
In the US, Sam's Club continued to grow membership count and increase its penetration of plus members, 
resulting in 50% membership income growth, while Walmart+ membership income grew double digits again this 
quarter. Within International, membership income in China from our Sam's Club business grew more than 30% as 
member counts continue to increase. 
 
For marketplace and Walmart fulfillment services, in the US, marketplace grew 42% in Q3, and we've now seen 
more than 30% growth in each of the past 5 quarters. The number of sellers on the platform continued to grow 
double digits, and SKU count is approaching 700 million items, with a broader assortment of the brands and items 
customers want, marketplace sales in beauty, toys, hardlines and home all grew more than 20%. We continue to 
leverage our next-generation supply chain and technology to provide fulfillment for sellers at some of the lowest 
rates in the industry. As a result, more sellers are using our marketplace fulfillment services with WFS sales 
penetration reaching record highs at more than 40%.

Outside of the US, we're seeing similar encouraging trends. For example, our marketplaces in Mexico, Canada 
and Chile combined increased items by 20% versus last year. In Mexico, the number of items delivered through 
WFS grew over 50%. And during Flipkart's Big Billion Day's event, we experienced same-day delivery growth, 2.5 
times higher than last year. This quarter, Flipkart also launched its quick commerce service called Flipkart 
Minutes in a number of cities, offering delivery in under 15 minutes for a variety of items, including groceries and 
electronics. And within data analytics and insights, Walmart Data Ventures continues to grow rapidly with net 
sales up double digits. Our client base has more than doubled over the past year, and we're excited about 
continuing to broaden our reach to new markets by launching the platform in Canada this month. 
 
As a reminder, the margin gains we've reported this year in the US have been burdened by meaningful product 
headwinds from the outsized sales growth in health and wellness relative to general merchandise. Our plan calls 
for general merchandise to improve in future quarters, but to continue to underperform health and wellness and 
grocery until we return to more normalized purchasing cycle across GM categories. We remain focused on 
building out our marketplace assortment and emphasizing early emerging categories like apparel, home décor, 
and automotive supplies. We're continuing to optimize our business to deliver greater efficiency, and we're 
committed to balancing ongoing investments with improved returns for customers, associates and shareholders. 
 
Our evolving business model, with more diversified and durable sources of profit, has provided the ability to fund 
investments, while also delivering on our financial framework of operating income growing faster than sales. Price 
gaps remain healthy, and we continue to advocate on behalf of customers for lower prices. Wrapping up Q3 
results. Consolidated operating income grew 9.8% in constant currency and adjusted EPS increased nearly 14% 
to $0.58 per share. 
 
Now turning to guidance. We are raising our full year guidance to reflect strong third quarter results. On a 
constant currency basis, we now expect full year sales growth of 4.8% to 5.1% and operating income growth of 
8.5% to 9.25% versus prior guidance of growth of 3.75% to 4.75% and 6.5% to 8%, respectively. 
 
Compared to our guidance that we provided at the start of the year, we now expect operating income to grow 
nearly 400 basis points more at the midpoint. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $2.42 and $2.47 versus 
prior guidance of $2.35 to $2.43. This full year guidance implies fourth quarter constant currency growth in sales 
of around 3% to 4% and operating income around 5% to 7.5%. This guidance is slightly above our prior implied 
Q4 range and contemplates a series of wage investments that Sam's Club announced on September 17 to be 
effective in Q4. 
 
Recall that we guide sales and operating income growth on a constant currency basis. Currency fluctuations 
impacted the business negatively in Q3 after being a tailwind in Q1 and neutral in Q2. 
 
In Q3, currency pressure reported sales and operating income growth by about 70 basis points and 160 basis 
points, respectively. If rates stay where they are currently, we would expect a headwind to Q4 reported sales and 
operating income growth of approximately 100 basis points and 200 basis points, respectively. 
 
In closing, while we still have one more quarter to go before we close out this year, we're really encouraged by 
our operational and financial performance. We have a lot of conviction in our strategy. And the leaders sitting 
around the table with me today, along with our team of over 2 million associates around the world, are executing 
on it. Hopefully, you share my sentiment and are as excited as we are to see what else is to come. 
 
We appreciate your interest in Walmart and are now ready to take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION 
 
 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Kate 
McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Kate McShane 
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q 
Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking our question. We wanted to focus our question today on general 
merchandise and gross margins. While general merchandise inflected positive in the quarter, it still seems like mix 
is a headwind, based on everything you walked through today. Do you have a view on when this gets more 
balanced? And if we were to see a more balanced growth rate in general merch versus consumables and the 
growth of the alternative revenue businesses, what could gross margin expansion look like? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

C. Douglas McMillon 
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Walmart, Inc. A 
Hey Kate, this is Doug. As it relates to general merchandise, I'll go first and then ask all three of the segment 
leaders to speak. We love general merchandise. First-party – being a first-party merchant's something that we 
obviously grew up doing. And when you go into our stores and clubs right now, the seasonal impact of GM is 
exciting and energizing. And so, this is something that we're passionate about. 
 
And in today's world, we can grow first-party general merchandise in stores, in clubs, plus through e-commerce, 
with both pickup and delivery and the expansion of the marketplace. So I think we've got a lot of opportunity kind 
of big picture from a GM point of view. 
 
John, why don't you go first, and then Chris and Kath can chime in. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

John R. Furner 
President & Chief Executive Officer-Walmart U.S., Walmart, Inc. A 
Sure. Good morning, Kate. Thanks for the question. As Doug said, we're excited about the season. We're excited 
about seasonal merchandising. I've been in stores just the last couple of months in Utah, California, last week, 
Philadelphia, Tennessee, the list goes on and on, and the stores are ready. They are really set for the season. 
 
We had a good back-to-school. We had a good Halloween. And it's important to string these holidays together. So 
we go into the season with momentum. We're excited about that. We think we have a great plan for the season. 
It's early November. So the team will be working on consistent execution the next couple months to deliver the 
best quarter we can for our customers. 
 
As we said, general merchandise has improved. We are still experiencing some deflation in general 
merchandises in the low to mid-single digits range. That hasn't changed for some time, but we were positive in 
comp due to growth in units, primarily coming out of, as we said earlier, home, toys, some of our hardlines 
categories. We're seeing some real bright spots as well in the marketplace with fashion and apparel, really excited 
about the mix. 
 
So we have a lot of ways that we can deliver to the customers, whether it's in the store, which really excited, 
again, as I said, about the stores being set seasonally, and with our commerce business growing at 22% in the

quarter, that puts us in a spot with some momentum as we enter the fourth quarter. Maybe, Chris, go to you at 
Sam's. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Chris Nicholas 
President & Chief Executive Officer-Sam's Club, Walmart, Inc. A 
Yeah. Thanks, John. I mean, just a lot of similarity there with us. We love general merchandise. We get very 
excited about items. And if you think about the way that we've constructed all of our strategic priorities, this is not 
just a consumables and food game. It's definitely a GM game. 
 
If you think about increasing digital engagement, the growth in e-commerce, that helps people see the great items 
we've got, then investing in the value proposition. We're investing in Grapevine. 
 
And Doug talked about it in his opening remarks. We've put a lot of effort into how we merchandise both the items 
you can buy in a club, but also the items that you can buy online, in this online to offline connectivity. 
 
And it's really powerful. And we're seeing significant increases in the participation of general merchandise in that 
club, which I think is the best articulation of our strategy physically that we have today. 
 
There's a couple of other things I'd say. From a comp point of view, we're really happy to see the second comp – 
second quarter of positive comps on GM. But units are still moving ahead of comps, so there's still good value out 
there. 
 
And similar to John, like in home, tech, toys, Seasonal Decor all doing really well. And back to college and 
Halloween, were also really strong, so we see that momentum continuing. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Kathryn J. McLay 
President & Chief Executive Officer-Walmart International, Walmart, Inc. A 
Yeah. And I say from an international perspective, we saw strong growth in GM in Mexico, India and China. And 
not surprisingly, in those markets, too, convenience is really important. 
 
And so as we kind of are growing our strength in delivery from a same day and also within the hour, we're seeing 
the GM growth continue to kind of correlate with that convenience play. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

C. Douglas McMillon 
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Walmart, Inc. A 
I think to drive GM growth over the next few years, e-commerce becomes crucial. Obviously, we've seen good 
growth there recently, but we've got a lot more opportunity. 
 
And this week, when we were in Mexico last week, we saw a Pop-Up Toy Shop outside of one of our stores that 
is just dominant in the toy category. It looks gorgeous, fun to shop, kids love it. We just have such an opportunity 
in the physical world as well as in the digital world to create excitement with general merchandise.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 19-Nov-2024 
 
Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. What is Walmart finding out about its ability to drive 
steady growth in the core business, while reinvesting back in areas like price and wages to lay the foundation for 
the future? 
 
And as the company generates more evidence of the growth of the emerging alternative revenue stream, does it 
make sense to invest even more in these areas? Or are they diminishing returns such that the overall enterprise-
wide profit growth can accelerate next year and beyond, even as you make sizable investments back in the 
business? Thank you so much. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

C. Douglas McMillon 
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Walmart, Inc. A 
Yeah. Thanks, Michael. This is a real-time conversation that we have all the time, are we investing the right 
amount back? You called out prices and wages. I think those are the two areas that would come to the top of our 
list, too. 
 
We think we are investing the right amounts, obviously, but it is a fluid situation. We watch price gaps. We watch 
what's happening in the employment market and have freedom now to be able to make different investments, if 
we want to. 
 
So I think from a kind of an income statement point of view, I feel like we're being appropriately aggressive. And 
on the capital side, you know that we've made some significant decisions over the last few years to invest in 
automation in the supply chain, for example. But we're also being, I think very aggressive as it relates to store and 
club remodels. So I feel like on the capital side, we're also being aggressive. And as we do that, because of the 
way that we've set ourselves up, we can grow profit faster than sales and do those things at the same time. It's 
just a matter of degree, and we will manage that as we go from week to week. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

John David Rainey 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Walmart, Inc. A 
Yeah. Michael, I would add to Doug's point that we feel like we're striking the right balance between profit 
expansion and investment in the business. We're all very focused on making sure that we are healthy for the next 
generation. We certainly provide an outlook over the next three to five years, but we want to continue to have the 
same type of financial performance after that. And that requires a level of investment in the business. And as 
Doug said, we feel like we're striking that balance appropriately. 
 
In terms of the – your part of the question about our ability to maybe accelerate profits into the future. Look, we're 
comfortable with the outlook that we provided where we said that the way to think about our financial architecture 
over the next several years is that operating income will grow faster than sales and sales should, on average, be 
about 4%. Some years will be a little better, some years may be a little bit worse. 
 
We've had two years now since we provided that outlook. And if you look at our performance last year and our 
performance year-to-date, along with our guidance this year, that would suggest that on the top line, we've grown 
about 5% and grown profits about 10%. We're really pleased about that. But that is not a matter of us being overly 
conservative or anything like that. It's really a matter of execution by the team sitting around this table. 
 
With anything that we do, with any strategy that we have, there's always going to be things where – areas where 
you overperform and underperform. But what you've seen is this team has done a really good job at executing on 
the basics and also our newer, faster-growing businesses. And so that's reflected in our financial performance.

we've laid out is still what we believe today.

Simeon Ari Gutman 
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q 
Good morning. Hi, everyone. I wanted to talk about the top line, which it looks like it accelerated Q3 versus Q2, 
the underlying run rate. There were some storms, and I know you mentioned port strike. Can you talk about the 
underlying inflection you're seeing? What do we attribute it to? I don't know if it's merchandising, marketplace, 
membership, all the above? And have we inflected, does it feel like we've inflected to a higher growth rate? Thank 
you. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

C. Douglas McMillon 
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Walmart, Inc. A 
To me, it feels like it's pretty consistent. Like if you look at what happened in the first three quarters in the 
underlying rate and then you look at what happened in this most recent quarter with the storms, things did 
increase a bit, but I still feel like we're kind of running the same level of momentum in the same economy. The 
fourth quarter will be fun to watch. The calendar is not our favorite with fewer days between Thanksgiving and 
Christmas. And I suspect when all that's said and done, it will be similar to the kind of momentum that we've seen 
in the first three quarters. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

John David Rainey 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Walmart, Inc. A 
Yeah. Simeon, I'd add that it does feel very consistent to us. The one exception to that is maybe the timing of the 
Big Billion Days event. As you know, that can fall into the third quarter, some years, fourth quarter, other years, 
goes back and forth because of the way it fell this year. It added about 60 basis points of growth to the top line for 
us in 3Q. It also will work against us in 4Q. But other than that, which is just a timing element, the business is 
performing very constantly, as Doug said.

Christopher Horvers 
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q 
Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Can you speak to the changes in the 4Q operating income guide relative to 
where you started the year ex the FX change? To what extent did you change the top-line outlook overall and in 
US? Then you called out Sam's wage investment, but was there any changes in your expectation around gross 
margin given what you're seeing in the alternate profit pools and 4Q is a big spike in terms of volume. So could 
that tilt the US e-commerce business to profitability? Thank you. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

John David Rainey 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Walmart, Inc. A 
I'll address this and others may want to join in. Chris, the way to probably characterize this, if you look at our 
guidance last quarter versus what's implied this quarter, there's a modest improvement in 4Q performance.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 19-Nov-2024 
 
There's not been a lot of change before that in terms of our outlook for 4Q. The business has been performing as 
we've said, pretty consistent. 
 
In terms of GM, maybe one thing that has improved and been a little bit better than what we expected at the 
beginning of the year. And by GM, I'm talking gross margin is shrink. Shrink has performed a little bit better in the 
US and Sam segment for the first part of the year here. But other than that, the business is continuing to perform 
very consistently with prior quarters. 
 
You do – some of the more digital businesses, the newer businesses that we have, did inflect a little bit higher in 
3Q. I think also keep in mind that, that's a function of the movement of Big Billion Days that I just mentioned. But if 
you just – you go down list, you look at as an enterprise, 28% advertising growth, 42% marketplace growth, 22% 
membership income growth like we are executing. Our value proposition is resonating with customers, and that's 
why you're seeing this gain share. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

C. Douglas McMillon 
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Walmart, Inc. A 
As it relates to profitability in e-commerce, we don't think we should race to it. This is a long-term game. The 1P, 
3P mix is one dimension to manage, for example. And if we should carry more first-party items and that somehow 
delays crossing a threshold of profitability, we're good with that because that's what customers want. That's what 
will drive growth. If investments in delivery speed cause us to reach profitability a little later, that's fine, too. We 
want to deliver faster. 
 
So I think we are very confident that we're going to make money in e-commerce. Whether that happens today, 
tomorrow or a week from now or a month from now or a quarter from now, I don't really care. The total works, and 
we've got a great opportunity to grow our e-commerce business. So I'm leaning long-term. And at some point, 
we'll tell you guys we made money in e-commerce and then just move on and not have that conversation 
anymore. 
 
And as we've said several times, when you look at the shape of the new income statement and you split it 
between the original income statement that looks like a store P&L and the newer income statement that's got 
membership, advertising, fulfillment services, data monetization and maybe some other things in it, it's more 
profitable. It just took a period of investment for us to get there. 
 
So again, we'll grow profit faster than sales. E-commerce will be part of the mix. Omni is our life, which we love. 
We think it's an advantaged position. And we look forward to someday telling you that we made money in e-
commerce globally as it obviously varies by country as well.

Robert F. Ohmes 
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc. Q 
Well, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Doug, this may be for you. I get a lot of questions on the 
share gains with upper-income consumers you guys keep talking about. I was hoping you could sort of talk about 
it across three dimensions: grocery versus general merchandise with that upper income consumer, price driving 
that versus convenience with that and then sort of stores versus this huge marketplace growth in terms of driving 
the upper income consumer.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 19-Nov-2024 
 
C. Douglas McMillon 
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Walmart, Inc. A 
Yes. Robby, I'll go first, but I'll invite John or others to chime in here, too. It is an all of the above answer. We want 
to sell grocery and GM. And if you go through and look at it by category by income level, it kind of plays out the 
same way general merchandise does in that people come to us to shop as a primary destination in many 
instances, and then they give us feedback across categories. 
 
And if you look at our offer in food and consumables, our shares are pretty high and consistent relative to some of 
the things we see in general merchandise. So over the years, we had a really strong market share in categories 
like toys, bicycles, but we had a lower market share in a lot of fashion categories. And that's basically just the 
customer telling us over the years, I'd rather buy my apparel somewhere else. 
 
But in an omni world, we have an opportunity with brands, we have an opportunity with presentation to increase 
the amount of market share we have in some of those categories where we should have had a higher share all 
along. And that e-commerce opportunity is kind of bearing out as. We grow our assortment, we're able to appeal 
to more people and appeal to higher income levels. 
 
So when I think about it from a category point of view, the themes look the same to me. We have more 
opportunity in fashion areas than we do in basic areas, and that's always been true. 
 
As it relates to price versus convenience, everybody wants to save money and everybody wants to save time, but 
it's a continuum. And those that have more discretionary income and want to save time are liking what we're 
doing with both pickup and delivery. And I think that's one of the things that makes this moment in time different. 
 
We do get the question from time to time about whether this is sustainable. I look at what's happened with 
Walmart+ and the relationship you get through a membership, what's happened with our remodels what's 
happened with convenience and it gives me more optimism that this is something that's going to last a long time 
and it was a different inflection point. Did I leave anything, John, for you to add? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

John R. Furner 
President & Chief Executive Officer-Walmart U.S., Walmart, Inc. A 
Well, that was... 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

C. Douglas McMillon 
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Walmart, Inc. A 
Sorry. That wasn't what I meant. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

John R. Furner 
President & Chief Executive Officer-Walmart U.S., Walmart, Inc. A 
No, no, no. Right on. I'll just add a couple of things there, Doug. I think you covered a lot of it. But Robby, we do 
get the question from time to time, and we talk about the different ways that we can serve consumers and how 
that's different from, say, a decade ago or even five years ago. As we've become omni, we have the ability to sell 
customers in the store, at the curb, deliver to their home. And we can do that whenever they want and in many 
cases, however they want. And you heard earlier the number of orders that are sub three hours and people are 
prioritizing time and price.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 19-Nov-2024 
 
So one of your questions is, is not an or, we want to be a great price, and we want to be convenient, and we can 
do both at the same time. The expansion and delivery catchments, the expansion with delivery density and the 
hours of operations have helped us lower our costs, which enable us to serve customers more flexibly. So we can 
do both of those at the same time. 
 
In categories like grocery, yes, price obviously matters. And so does quality. We do see, and as we noted earlier, 
a large percentage of our market share gains came from higher income customers that has been happening for 
several quarters. And we see categories like gluten-free and dry grocery, or grass-fed beef, organic produce, 
where our share and pickup and delivery is much higher and the mix is higher than in store. So we can be a great 
opening price point value in the store, and we can sell high quality, and we can deliver it the way that the 
customers want. 
 
And then last thing, as Doug did mention this expansion in e-commerce. Congrats to the team for another quarter 
with momentum at 22% growth. But leading that growth is our marketplace team and our marketplace business, 
which just tells you that our customers are looking for more of an assortment than they've had in the years prior to 
this one from Walmart, and we're seeing bright spots in apparel, in toys, in healthy food. So it's across the world. 
We have a lot of work left to do. Our assortment is growing. We think that will continue to happen over the next 
couple of years, but it's great to see the momentum across so many channels. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Chris Nicholas 
President & Chief Executive Officer-Sam's Club, Walmart, Inc. A 
Maybe just push in from a Sam's point of view. Whilst we serve all income cohorts, we do definitely skew higher 
than the core of Walmart. And what I would say is that, they love price more than anybody. Like price is a core 
competitive advantage of ours. But great items at great prices, we think isn't enough. And so you're seeing an 
acceleration in all of the metrics in Sam's because we're also leaning into experience. And a big part of that is 
convenience. And we're really excited to see the impact of that.

Krisztina Katai 
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q 
Hi, good morning, Doug and John David. I wanted to dig into the strength of e-commerce a little bit. I was curious 
if you could talk about what you think is a sustainable level of growth on a go-forward basis. Clearly, it's a much 
larger business, but you have a lot more that are driving it as well, whether we think about marketplace and 
membership. But just how do you see the rapid expansion of marketplace sellers and SKUs contribute to both e-
commerce growth and as we think about improving the profitability over next several quarters? And as part of 
that, can you talk about general merchandise performance, what you saw both in stores and in the marketplace? 
And then just from an assortment perspective, as we think about newness and innovation that you called out, just 
what specifically are you excited most about holiday? Thank you. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

C. Douglas McMillon 
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Walmart, Inc. A 
Is that all, Krisztina? I'm excited about this year. Not only the great items we have, but the convenience that we're 
going to provide. And I think you could just take our e-commerce growth rate over the last, I don't know, 8 
quarters and look at the trend line. And you can expect that we're going to continue investing to create a better 
customer experience to result in more growth.

We have a relatively low market share in e-commerce versus brick-and-mortar, and that's our opportunity. I think 
all the investments we're putting in place, including supply chain automation, are aimed at capturing that 
opportunity. There's such a nice connection between these businesses. As you grow e-commerce first-party, for 
example, you get the opportunity to grow third-party. As you go first and third-party e-commerce businesses, you 
get an opportunity to sell an ad, to sell a membership for delivery, to get additional data. And it all does work 
together in a mutually reinforcing way. And so as I mentioned just a minute ago, that's nice for us in that it mixes 
us up. It not only gives us top line growth, but it gives us bottom line growth. 
 
I'll just wrap up by saying it is still an item business, and it's still fun. Like we talk these days a lot about our 
technology and our investments, but when it gets to this time of year in particular, the hot toy is going to be fun to 
talk about, the Thanksgiving meal that's a lower price this year than it was a year ago is fun to be part of. We're 
sitting in a room today that's got a bit of Christmas feel to it, decor-wise, and it's exciting to be in this part of the 
year.

proceed with your question. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Scot Ciccarelli 
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc. Q 
Good morning, guys. So I think you've given us some numbers previously on how much of your EBITDA growth 
was coming from your ancillary revenue streams. So the questions are, do you have a number for that this 
quarter? And then is it possible to rank the drivers between advertising, membership, 3P, et cetera? Thanks. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

John David Rainey 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Walmart, Inc. A 
Scot, this is John David. I'll take that. The numbers this quarter are pretty similar to the last quarter. So, 
membership fees, as well as advertising income, contributed to a little more than half of our operating income 
improvement and a little shy of a third of the overall operating income for the business. Those are important 
growth drivers to our business, but they don't work without getting the basics right on core retail. So I think we're 
striking a nice balance for all of that. 
 
It is worth noting that this quarter, our business is 18% e-commerce. And reflecting back on Krisztina's question, 
that's a 300 basis point improvement from this point last year. So we continue to make progress in these digital 
channels. And clearly, our customers are finding value in what they're finding at Walmart. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Kathryn J. McLay 
President & Chief Executive Officer-Walmart International, Walmart, Inc. A 
Can I just add on that one, too? I think if you look at our results, we've consistently grown profit faster than sales 
every quarter this year. And when you break it down, it's largely those ancillary businesses that are higher margin, 
that are driving the result. 
 
I look at our advertising business was up 50%, and that is largely because of BBD. But the other markets growth 
is also strong, and we'll see that kind of as you look at the half versus the quarter.

When we look at the growth in those businesses, its advertising revenue, its membership. We're seeing like 
membership grow across each of the individual markets with slightly different offerings, but all of them tailored to 
what are the needs of the local consumers. 
 
So that, with the addition of financial services as well, is really helping that whole model play out. And the 
consistency of the execution across quarters, I think, has been one of the things I'm most proud of. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

John David Rainey 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Walmart, Inc. A 
Maybe one more thing to add, whether it's the international business or here in the United States, when we look at 
the composition of growth in GMV for us, as an example, there's a healthy balance between increased traffic and 
improved conversion. So you've got more shoppers that are coming to Walmart or Walmart properties that are 
finding value in price and convenience. 
 
But we're also getting better at how we serve those customers, and I say that through conversion. Like we're 
getting better at converting someone who may just be eyeballs looking at our website, to actually completing a 
checkout and putting something in their basket and having it delivered to their house. So we're pleased with our 
progress, but it also indicates we still have a long ways to go. We know that we can get better, and our team is 
very focused on that.

Peter Jacob Keith 
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co. Q 
Hey, thank you. Good morning. So maybe as a follow-up to Scot's question. You did flag general merchandise 
should continue to improve in the coming quarters. And I'm wondering if that continued improvement could have 
positive implications for some of these high-value revenue streams, such as marketplace, which accelerated 
nicely here, and supplier advertising and the like? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

John David Rainey 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Walmart, Inc. A 
Sure. Peter, everything else being equal, you would expect that to have a positive benefit to the P&L as GM items 
tend to carry a higher gross margin than many of the grocery items. So we look forward to being able to benefit 
from that. But some of that is on us and continuing to grow our assortment through our marketplace, but some of 
it is a function of the economy overall. And so we'll watch that closely.

C. Douglas McMillon 
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Walmart, Inc. A 
Peter, this is Doug. I think the only thing that I would say is that, the competitive set we focus on today is different. 
And it's changing overtime, probably at a more rapid rate than it used to. 
 
Being in China and Mexico recently, we have some strong competitors there. And the ones we're focused on and 
learning from are different, than the ones they were – that we were focused on just a few years ago. 
 
Here in the US, we have fierce competition from all kinds of different directions. So our mindset is to be aware, to 
watch, to learn. And when we see the customer responding to something, react if it makes sense for us to react 
and to change, if we need to change. 
 
So we try stay focused straight ahead, eyes on customers, members focused on our associates, have our 
competitors in our peripheral vision, but study them and learn and apply. I think you can see that in some of our 
results today.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Melius Research. Please 
proceed with your question.

Karen Short 
Analyst, Melius Research LLC Q 
Hi. Thanks for taking my question and its good to talk to you again. My – I kind of have two interrelated questions. 
So, your OpEx at 21.2% wondering what the potential is to get closer to 19% or get back to 19%? And obviously, 
that's in the context of e-com, as it relates to losses. 
 
And then the second question is just with all these alternative revenue streams that you have, at what point are 
you looking at a materiality conversation? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

John David Rainey 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Walmart, Inc. A 
Karen, clearly, those questions are for me. This is John David. We report – I'll take them in reverse order. We 
report on a segment basis right now. And that satisfies the requirements that we have for segment reporting. 
 
So we'll continue to report out by international Sam's in US If something changes in our business, we'll reevaluate 
that in the future. On OpEx, there are a couple of drivers, first of all, in the current quarter to increase. And then, 
I'll address your question related to where it could go. 
 
But in the current quarter, we saw a little bit more investment in marketing in the US business, and that's helping 
to drive some of the performance in general merchandise. So we're really pleased about that. 
 
The other is incentive pay for our frontline associates. We think it's important that our frontline associates are 
rewarded in the same way that shareholders are. And as we've outperformed this year, we've seen additional 
incentive pay for them, and that pressured SG&A in the third quarter. 
 
The other element gets to, I think, the essence of your question, which is the changing mix of our business. If you 
look at SG&A on a brick-and-mortar basis, it's less than what you had in digital channels.

And so as we continue to grow digitally, as we continue to have more of our business that's coming through e-
commerce, you're going to see some pressure on SG&A. That said, the team here is very focused on continue to 
try to provide everyday low-cost to enable us to have everyday low-prices for our customers. 
 
And so we'd love to get back to the 20% range on SG&A that requires work. But there's, in any company, and 
especially one our size, there's always opportunities for efficiencies and the use of technology to better serve our 
customers and members. So we're working on that, but you have to keep in mind going forward that as we get 
more digital, you're going to see pressure on the SG&A line.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Please proceed with 
your question.

Seth Sigman 
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Q 
Hey. Good morning, everyone. Obviously, the strength in the quarter was broad-based, but I wanted to focus on 
the acceleration in average ticket in the US I think that was the strongest in over a year. And I'm curious, if that 
was impacted by the hurricane or if there's some other type of inflection that you're starting to see in basket size, 
maybe an improvement in GM or attachments? Is that also maybe a benefit of attracting that higher-income 
consumer? Just any more context on that as we think about the run rate going forward? Thanks so much. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

John R. Furner 
President & Chief Executive Officer-Walmart U.S., Walmart, Inc. A 
Yeah. Morning. This is John. I think everything you said, it does represent some of the improvements that we did 
see in the quarter. We did mention that there were some tailwinds from some onetime events that happened in 
the quarter. But the thing that I'm really proud of the team is we had the highest growth in units in food that we've 
seen in several years, which is great. Our general merchandise business, as we mentioned, despite some 
deflation in the low single-digits and mid single-digits range, were positive comps. So the units outgrew that. 
 
It is all, I think, a reflection of starting with, are we selling the things that customers want to buy during the season 
they're in. Seasons are important. We ended October with a strong Halloween. So all those added up are 
important. And the shift from, I'd say, not necessarily from, but adding on digital business on top of our store 
business is helping us attract new customers and serve them well with the options that we have. The combination 
of both the product and the service offerings are working. The growth in the deliveries under three hours is 
impressive. The team is doing a great job with that, and we need to continue that. We know customers are 
looking for both value and they're looking to save time.

Please proceed with your question.

Gregory Scott Melich 
Analyst, Evercore ISI Q 
Hi. Thanks guys. I wanted to follow up on the membership growth and the – what's driving that there? And what 
sort of behavior you're seeing in terms of lift from people when they do sign up for Walmart+ in particular and 
what that flows through in terms of the importance of data and then using that in the new businesses?

Q3 2025 Earnings Call 19-Nov-2024 
 
John R. Furner 
President & Chief Executive Officer-Walmart U.S., Walmart, Inc. A 
Greg, its John. I'll start with Walmart+. Walmart+ is a really important part of the offer. And as we said this 
morning, we have a clear strategy. Our results reflect the financial framework that we've laid out. The growth in e-
commerce is an indicator of where the customer is headed and Walmart+ is a great way for customers to 
amortize the cost of delivery over time. 
 
And so when someone joins the program, we're focused right away on ensuring that we deliver their order on time 
when they ask for it, not ahead, not after and that the order is full and it's complete with as few substitutions as 
possible. And when we do that well, that opens up the ability for the business to talk to them about other things 
that are going on in their life, whether it's changing the tires on their car or helping them with a birthday cake. 
There are just so many things we can do in core retail that makes life easier, at a value for our customers. So this 
is an important part of the overall equation. 
 
We mentioned results up over double digit in Walmart+ again. So good to see the momentum. And looking from 
here forward, in this quarter, in particular, it's about executing really well. We need to be really clear on our offer. 
We need to pull the orders on time without substitutions, and we need to deliver to customers exactly what they're 
looking for. This is the time of the year when families get together for meals and gifts, and it's really important that 
we're there for them, and we enable them to have the best season they can have. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Kathryn J. McLay 
President & Chief Executive Officer-Walmart International, Walmart, Inc. A 
I'll just add from an international perspective, I think when we think about membership, there's a bit of a spectrum. 
So if you think about in Chile, we actually have a loyalty program, which allows us to have over 80% of our 
customers' data. 
 
And then if you look at it in Mexico, we've just launched Beneficios, which has allowed us to get 28 million 
members sign up, which allows us just to be a lot more personalized in the way that we show up for those 
members. Those are free loyalty membership programs right through to a paid membership where you're really 
bundling delivery capabilities. 
 
If you look at that, we're seeing growth across most of the major markets. But if I then just point to Sam's China, 
they've had membership income grow of over 30%. And I think that is a testament to the quality of their CVP and 
how attractive that is to our customers. Not only the in-club offering, but also the ability to do convenience with like 
over 80% of their deliveries being under an hour. 
 
So we think about membership as a way of driving loyalty to create the ability to personalize, to have a richer, 
stickier relationship with our members and to bundle up the ability to do delivery, which is something our 
customers are telling us is really important. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Chris Nicholas 
President & Chief Executive Officer-Sam's Club, Walmart, Inc. A 
Yeah. I think in Sam's Club, we had a 15.1% growth in membership income, but none of this is a gift. It's all an 
achievement. It's just hard work. John talked about execution. We are executing on our member value 
proposition, which is value, its assortment, its great experiences, and it's building that trust with the members so 
that you build a lifelong relationship with them.

We had some great results, as you've heard, in e-commerce and in Club, which we're really proud of. And we've 
seen the outcome of that. So great inputs give you great outcomes. And we've seen digital penetration increase 
400 basis points, Scan & Go up 350 basis points, and that's resulted in all-time high memberships, increase in 
Plus penetration is up 300 basis points, and our renewal is up 230%. So just really nailing those basics, listening 
to your members and giving them what they want gives you great outcomes. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

John David Rainey 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Walmart, Inc. 

All right. I want to thank everybody for joining us today. We look forward to engaging with many of you in the 
coming weeks and months at investor conferences. I want to ask you to mark your calendars for our next 
investment community meeting, which is on April 8, 9, 2025. Doug? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

C. Douglas McMillon 
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Walmart, Inc. 

Really proud and grateful to the team and of the team. The folks that are in this room are leaders more broadly 
and our associates around the world. They're doing a nice job of delivering short-term results, managing today 
and building for tomorrow at the same time so that we can continue this momentum. I think we are being 
appropriately aggressive as it relates to our level of investments, whether that's related to price or associate 
investments or automation, for example. 
 
And I'm really encouraged by the way folks are working together with our tech teams to build things in a way that's 
faster and more effective. We've got room to improve there. We probably always will. But when I look at what 
we're putting together, the combination of businesses, I think the outcome is one that can continue to grow the top 
line while growing the bottom line faster in a sustainable way, but while making the necessary investments as we 
work towards trying to serve people better. 
 
For decades, it's been my experience that our customers and members want four things from us. They want low 
prices. They want a really broad assortment of products and services. They want to have a great experience, and 
that includes convenience and saving them time. And they want to do business with somebody they trust. 
 
And in this business, you get what you earn. So we are working hard today to make sure that tomorrow, we're 
continuing to have quarters like the one we had this quarter. Thank you, all.

Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank
