29-Apr-2025

Thank you, Megan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This quarter marks true
momentum in our growth strategy in numbers, mindset and operations. For the past 18 months, we focused on
building the strength to fuel long-term growth. And today, we're seeing that strategy come to life. In the first
quarter, we increased revenue in each of our service lines, achieving mid-single digit organic growth in our
Services business, two quarters ahead of target.
We drove 100 basis points of year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margin improvement and further reduced leverage
by paying down an additional $25 million in debt. Since I took over as CEO, we have repaid $230 million in debt
and have successfully refinanced and repriced our debt five times, reducing our annual cash interest burden. And
in the same way that we have attacked our leverage over the past year, we are now attacking growth. And we are
delivering results ahead of schedule, entering new phases of expansion and building momentum, positioning
ourselves to win through the cycle.
Our disciplined investments have not only stabilized the business but have unlocked new areas of organic growth.
We've taken bold steps to remove complexity, better aligning teams to opportunities, and create the clarity and
agility that sustainable growth requires. We believe these changes will allow us to scale faster, move with purpose
and seize growth opportunities as they emerge. They are also enabling us to respond more quickly to market
shifts and uncertainties as we are operating much more nimbly than in the past.
Our key differentiator continues to lie in our ability to meet clients where they are and guide them on their desired
journey. Our flat organizational culture allows us to swiftly adapt to clients' buying patterns. We deliver customized
bespoke solutions, tailored to each client's needs instead of relying on predefined approaches. Our teams not
only work harder than our competitors, but they also work smarter. By fostering a culture of solutioning, problem
solving and trust, we let our people shine.
We recently held a call with our global think tank on current market conditions where we had upward of 4,000
clients joined to hear what our teams are thinking. Talent is a critical component of our growth strategy, and we
continue to attract strong teams to our platform. Year-to-date in the Americas, we have recruited Leasing and
Capital markets brokers with more average annual revenue than we recruited in all of 2024. All of this work is
culminating in momentum across our business.
For example, in the Americas, our pipeline of large Capital markets deals is 2 times the size it was one year ago.
In Americas Leasing and our multi-market occupier group, which represents roughly one-third of our tenant rep
business, our RFPs are up by 35% versus last year. In our Valuation business, bid volume was up 30% in Q1,
with March setting a two-year record for volume of bids.
In Services, in the past two years, our global occupier Services team has won all or a material part of the largest
outsourcing deals in the market. Our APAC Services business continues to demonstrate both resiliency and
momentum, with strong retention rates on existing contracts and five new sizable contracts coming online in the
first half of this year. And our C&W Services business, once referred to as our janitorial business, is now 70%
mechanical and engineering following a major contract win, making it more technical and a more strategic fit for
us. We've built a strong growth engine which is now powering us forward across every part of the business. We're
leaning in with clear purpose, excellent market positioning and a stronger foundation.
Now I'll turn the call over to Neil.

29-Apr-2025

Thank you, Michelle, and good morning, everyone. As a quick reminder, all prior comparisons will be in local
currency and any reference to organic growth excludes the impact of last year's non-core Services divestiture. We
achieved strong first quarter results that exceeded expectations. Our Brokerage business, consisting of Leasing
and Capital markets, carried over its momentum from the fourth quarter to achieve double digit growth and our
Services business on an organic basis reached mid-single digit growth ahead of schedule as our teams captured
incremental revenue opportunities throughout the quarter.
Fee revenue reached $1.5 billion, an increase of 4%, with organic fee revenue growing 6%. Adjusted EBITDA
rose 24% to $96 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 100 basis points versus prior year, beating our first
quarter guidance of flat year over year margins due primarily to greater than expected Leasing and Services
revenue as well as some expense timing benefits. Adjusted EPS increased to $0.09 from breakeven a year ago.
Importantly, we are achieving these results from a position of financial strength with net leverage at 3.9 times
EBITDA and free cash flow performing in line with our full year targets.
Now turning to our service line performance. Our Leasing business continued to show robust expansion in the
quarter, up 9%, even against solid compares from the prior year, demonstrating the sustainable trends propelling
global Leasing growth, including return to office mandates and the demand for quality space in all asset classes.
Americas Leasing remained a standout, growing by 14% in Q1, our third consecutive quarter of double-digit
growth. We experienced solid demand across the industrial and office sectors during the quarter, and our Leasing
pipeline has remained relatively stable.
APAC Leasing grew 16%, as the Australian market continued its momentum from the second half of last year and
China experienced a return to growth in the quarter. EMEA Leasing contracted 26%, primarily due to a difficult
comparison against last year when we closed several large Leasing deals. Capital markets continued its
expansionary trend, growing 11% globally. In the Americas, strong industrial performance was partially offset by a
slowdown in office transactions, resulting in 4% growth. APAC's 59% growth was primarily driven by strength in
Japan, while EMEA's 17% growth was driven by strength in the UK and in the Netherlands.
Moving on to Services. Our initiatives to improve top line growth in that business are already yielding results with
Services revenue on an organic basis up 4% in the quarter. We have reached our nearterm target of returning to
mid-single digit growth earlier than targeted and anticipate Services revenue growth to remain in this healthy midsingle digit range for the remainder of 2025.
In the Americas, organic Services fee revenue grew by 6%, driven by strength in facilities management and
facility services. EMEA Services continue to experience a reduction in project management work, while APAC
Services grew 3% with particular strength in India. Looking at our balance sheet and cash flow this quarter, free
cash flow was a use of $167 million. Our first quarter use of cash is in line with historical working capital trends,
including annual payment of US bonuses and reflects typical seasonal patterns in our business. Our trailing 12month free cash flow was approximately 60% of adjusted net income, and we expect to achieve our full year
target of 60% to 80% free cash flow conversion.
During the quarter, we completed another repricing of $1 billion of term loan debt, lowering the applicable interest
rate by 25 basis points. We also paid off a further $25 million in debt due in 2030. We closed the quarter with $1.7
billion in liquidity and have no funded debt maturities until 2028. Reducing our leverage and interest expense
through well-timed repayments and repricings will continue to be a key component of our capital allocation
strategy this year.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call

Corrected Transcript
29-Apr-2025

Now moving to our guidance. The guidance we presented on our last earnings call in February remains
essentially unchanged. While we are clearly operating in a dynamic and rapidly evolving macro landscape, we
remain focused on driving continued improved execution and managing towards long-term growth. Given our
strong first quarter performance, we continue to expect the full year revenue targets we provided last quarter are
achievable. However, given that the range of possible outcomes for the economy has widened, we will remain
flexible and watchful of the operating environment and make any necessary adjustments, just as we've done
successfully over the past several years.
Specifically for the full year, we expect Leasing growth in the mid-single digits. We expect Capital markets growth
to exceed 2024's mid-single digit growth rate. We expect Services to achieve mid-single digit top line growth for
the full year. This is an improvement compared to our previous guidance of achieving a mid-single digit run rate
by mid-year. On the cost side, our plans to accelerate investments in the business this year are unchanged, and
we'll continue to balance increased investment spend with a focus on long-term returns and managing the
business through the cycle.
In conclusion, we're very pleased with our performance this quarter and remain confident in our path ahead. We
continue to expect EPS growth in 2025 to exceed the growth we reported in 2024 and to further accelerate in
2026.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Michelle.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michelle M. MacKay
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

Thanks, Neil. We continue to believe that we are at the beginning of a multi-year recovery in commercial real
estate. We have a management team that excels at navigating uncertainty across market cycles and a global
workforce that is proving time and time again that they will exceed expectations while continuing to raise the bar.
Given our improved balance sheet, enhanced execution and large market opportunity, we believe our shares
represent a compelling value opportunity for investors. I want to thank our teams, partners, clients and
shareholders, your belief in our vision fuels us every day. We are proud of how far we've come and we're even
more excited about where we are going.
Let me now hand the call back to the operator for questions.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call

29-Apr-2025

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And please limit
yourselves to one question and one follow-up. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. The
first question is from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ronald Kamdem
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Q

Hey, congrats on a great quarter. Just can we start with sort of the margin improvement, 100 basis points yearover-year, I think that number was expected to be flat three months ago. So, maybe can you talk about what the
outperformance, what drove that would be helpful?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil O. Johnston
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

A

Sure, Ron. Yeah, we're very pleased with the first quarter. Our Q1 margin versus expectations was driven
primarily by top line strength. We saw stronger than expected Leasing and Services. There was some expense
timing benefit, which accounted for approximately 30% of the beat. And as we look to the rest of the year, some of
that benefit from the expense timing will reverse primarily in the second quarter and the remainder of any potential
upside to margin will ultimately depend on the performance we see in our service lines, especially in Leasing and
Capital markets as the year progresses.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ronald Kamdem
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Q

Great. And then my follow-up would be, I think the comment on whether it's the Capital markets or the Leasing or
the pipeline sounded pretty encouraging. It sounds like since April 2, there hasn't really been that much impact
from tariffs and you're still in a wait and see mode. So, I guess, my question is just, how would you characterize
the environment in April specifically and how are you guys thinking about the impact of tariffs on Leasing and
Capital markets businesses? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michelle M. MacKay
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

A

Thanks for the question, Ron. The tariff uncertainty not materially impacted our sector. We're continuing to see
improving trends in office and strong demand for high quality products. And say, in the industrial sector, we also
continue to see absorption of space is performing in line with our expectations for the year. I would say that when
you consider our business in today's market conditions and you think about client behavior, which is really what
you're talking about, our data is showing that their decision making is really falling into two buckets.
Group one of our clients that are going forward with the decisions on the existing timeline they have, and this is, I
would say, about 90% to 95% of what we've seen out of our clients through mid-April. These are clients that are
confident. They're making choices. They're moving through the noise in the market. And then there's group two.
And I would say this is 5% or less of what we're seeing today. Our clients who are opting to delay their decisions
today, but will make that decision later in 2025. So, what we're not witnessing is a freeze in decision making, and
that's in large part why we see our Q2 numbers and frankly, our 2025 performance staying intact.

Q1 2025 Earnings Call

29-Apr-2025

Ronald Kamdem

Q

Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Great. That's it for me. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: The next question is from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Anthony Paolone

Q

Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Hi, thanks. Good morning. Maybe continuing on the macro, do you have a view as to what might happen to the
office Leasing business if we do go into recession and maybe, does that follow the normal historical pattern of
weakening significantly? Or do you think the fact that it's coming off maybe the lows that, that mitigates it? Just
wondering what your thoughts are there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michelle M. MacKay

A

Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

Yeah. I mean, again, based on the data that we're seeing, demand for office Leasing remains really strong
through the quarter. And we haven't seen the uncertainty in the economy impact occupiers' confidence to move
forward with their workplace strategies or signing long-term leases, lease terms are getting longer. They're up to
about 77 months on average in Q1. And so, I think when we're projecting our forward models, we do some
sensitivity around softening, Tony, but nothing that significant.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Anthony Paolone

Q

Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Okay, thanks. And then, Michelle, I think you alluded to some of the recruiting efforts there. Can you maybe just
talk a bit more about recruiting and retention and just kind of how you think about where the system sits today
versus maybe six months, a year ago and just all things being equal, like just magnitude of kind of what you've
done on the people front.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michelle M. MacKay

A

Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

Yeah, sure. And I want to talk a little bit about the philosophy of our approach in this market, because we plan to
invest consistently regardless of market conditions and talent. And over the next 18 months, we've really
strengthened ourselves.
So, we're going to focus on Capital markets talent, Leasing talent, investing organically in the business. I think I
said on the last earnings call, we shared that we hired 10 Capital markets teams in the Americas in late 2024, and
now we've had an additional eight Capital markets teams since our last call join us. And we also haven't taken our
foot off of the gas in Leasing either. We've hired another 20 Leasing teams already in the US this year. So, we're
full steam ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Anthony Paolone

Q

Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Okay. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: The next question is from Peter Abramowitz with Jefferies. Please go ahead.

Peter Abramowitz

Q

Analyst, Jefferies LLC

Yes. Thanks for taking the time and congrats on a strong quarter here. I have a question similar to Tony's, but I
wanted to touch on the industrial Leasing side of things, just given everything going on with potential trade war
would seem to be kind of the most directly impacted sector. So, just curious how you're thinking about that,
maybe what you're seeing in trends post Liberation Day. And how you're thinking about the rest of 2025 overall.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michelle M. MacKay

A

Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

Sure. Look, we believe we've been outperforming in industrial Leasing for the past year, year and a half. And
we're still seeing positive trends in industrial Leasing revenues in the Americas, in five of the last six quarters that
we've had here, including Q1. But as we discussed last quarter, we didn't come into the year with unrealistic
expectations around Leasing growth and expected some normalization of demand. But what hasn't changed,
even in the midst of the tariff discussions, is the businesses still need industrial space to get their products to their
customers and we're helping them figure that out and executing on their strategies, whether they're the old
strategies or they're the modified strategies.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Peter Abramowitz

Q

Analyst, Jefferies LLC

Okay. Thanks, Michelle. That's helpful. And then one other question. I guess just on the rate outlook, we've seen
a lot of volatility. Is there sort of a frictional level, whether it be in the tenure, or whether that it be in the spreads,
where you start to maybe question or get a little bit concerned about the Capital markets business? I know one of
your competitors mentioned a 5% 10-year is kind of that technical level. Just wondering how you think about that
and how we should think about the sensitivities on the Capital markets side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michelle M. MacKay

A

Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

Yeah, we don't hold exactly the same point of view. I think all-in borrowing costs is really what you're looking at.
And so, that also considers credit spread for that particular borrower. And I understand that we quite often think
about Capital markets as an asset specific level of borrowing, but many large investors have other ways of
borrowing, even at the corporate level, to facilitate transactions. So, when I'm looking at our Capital markets
pipeline now, in large measure, our clients are closing deals and financings if they like them. But if they're not so
compelled by the financing market, a lot of these players still can cut a full cash check, and they're doing so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Peter Abramowitz

Q

Analyst, Jefferies LLC

All right. That's all for me. Thank you.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. Please go
ahead.

Patrick Mcilwee
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC

Q

Hi, team. Here, Pat Mcilwee on this morning. My first question, I know you mentioned that weakness in EMEA
Leasing was driven by a tough comparison quarter, but looks like Services revenue came in a bit soft as well. So,

just wanted to ask if you could provide some more commentary on what you're seeing in that region in terms of
both macro and within your business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil O. Johnston

A

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

Yeah, sure. As we look at EMEA, I think you've got to put it in context. EMEA as a whole is probably our weakest
economy in terms of our three segments. So, that is sort of weighing on the results in EMEA. But we are certainly
seeing some green shoots. For example, in Capital markets, we had very nice growth in the UK and you've seen
the ECB drop rates there. So, I think that's conducive to Capital markets.
On the Leasing side, we did have those large deals I spoke about, that accounted for about half of the weakness.
But I think the economics now playing through. And then on the Services side, what we did see is we saw the final
unwind of some of the project management work we've been doing around the business. But even there, there
were some green shoots. About half of our business there is property management and we actually saw that
grow. So, we feel like EMEA is at the bottom of the cycle. It'll be a slow recovery given the general economic
environment there. But I think that gives you a lot of color around what we're seeing in that market.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patrick Mcilwee

Q

Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC

Yeah. Thanks, Neil. That's helpful. And then you spoken a little bit about this, but you continue to invest in talent
and the business as a whole out of growth. But you also continue to repay debt, which you did again this quarter.
So, I just wanted to ask how you plan to balance defense versus offense in this environment? And has that
balance changed at all since your last call in February?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michelle M. MacKay

A

Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

Yeah, balance hasn't changed. Capital allocation strategy hasn't changed. It continues to be focused on growth
and deleveraging to your point, with the growth as an investment, that's a higher percentage of our overall capital
allocation. But obviously, we're going to continue to delever at the same time.

Understood. Thanks, Michelle.
