MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION 
 
 
Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Delta Air Lines June Quarter 2023 Financial Results 
Conference Call. My name is Matthew, and I'll be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only 
mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is 
being recorded. [Operator Instructions] 
 
I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go 
ahead. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Julie Stewart 
Vice President-Investor Relations, Delta Air Lines, Inc. 

Thank you, Matthew. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our June quarter 2023 earnings call. 
Joining us from Atlanta today are CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; our CFO, Dan Janki. Ed will 
open the call with an overview of Delta's performance and strategy, Glen will provide an update on the revenue 
environment, and Dan will discuss costs and our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we'll take analyst 
questions. We please ask that you limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up, so we can get to as many 
of you as possible. And after the analyst Q&A, we will move to our media questions. 
 
Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future 
events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ 
materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are 
described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and all results exclude special 
items, unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations 
page at ir.delta.com. 
 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ed.

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. 

Thanks, Julie. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us. Today, thanks to the great work of our 
team, we announced record revenue and earnings, reflecting the strength of demand for and momentum of 
Delta's differentiated brand. During the June quarter, we generated earnings of $2.68 per share, a 90% increase 
over last year. This marks the highest quarterly earnings result in our history, an achievement that moves Delta 
beyond recovery and firmly on a great path forward. 
 
Revenue was 19% above last year, and we achieved a 17% operating margin. This resulted in operating income 
of $2.5 billion, bringing our operating profit over the last 12 months to $6 billion. We generated over $1 billion of 
free cash during the quarter, bringing our first half free cash flow to $3 billion. We continue to repay debt, and we 
reinstated a quarterly dividend, signifying strong execution on our three-year plan and creating value for our 
owners. 
 
At Delta, transportation is what we do, but experiences are what we deliver, and that's made possible by the 
exceptional service provided by the industry's best employees. The 90,000 Delta people continue to deliver for 
our customers during this busy summer season. Over the 4th of July weekend, our people delivered a great

operation, completing over 21,000 flights with a 99.5% completion factor, an industry-leading on-time 
performance. The Delta people continue to be recognized. During the quarter, The Points Guy ranked Delta as 
the best US airline for the fifth year in a row with consistently high scores for reliability, customer experience, 
network and loyalty. 
 
Sharing our success with our team is core to Delta's culture, and we continue to maintain a position of industry 
leadership on pay. During the quarter, eligible employees received a 5% pay increase on the 1st of April, and 
year-to-date, we have accrued over $660 million in profit-sharing, in fact more than the total profit-sharing paid out 
for full year 2022. We expect our profit-sharing payout next February will continue to lead the industry by a wide 
margin. We will always be guided by our values of putting our people and our customers first. They are the driving 
force of our success. I want to thank our entire team for all they do for Delta and our customers. 
 
As I've recently noted, the industry backdrop remains constructive. Air travel demand is strong and the consumer 
is in good financial shape, particularly the premium consumer base that we target. After years of spending on 
goods, consumers want to travel. It's their number one big ticket purchase priority and they desire premium 
experiences. No one provides this better than Delta. At the same time, aviation infrastructure is still fragile and the 
industry continues to face multiple constraints across the supply chain, aircraft delivery delays and training needs. 
As a result, we see a significant gap between the supply that is in place and what demand could sustain, and we 
expect this gap will remain for an extended period of time. 
 
Turning to our outlook, with our first half performance and visibility into the back half of the year, we are raising 
our full year outlook and now expect earnings of $6 to $7 per share. For the September quarter, demand 
momentum continues. We expect to deliver double-digit revenue growth, a mid-teens operating margin, and 
earnings of $2.20 to $2.50 per share. Glen and Dan will provide more details on the components of our outlook. 
As we move to 2024 and beyond, our path forward is clear. The strategy that we shared at our Investor Day just a 
few weeks ago positions Delta incredibly well for the future. 
 
Our long-term priorities are to run the world's best airline, unlock the power of our brand, transform through digital, 
and deliver long-term shareholder value. That strategy is underpinned by a commitment to financial performance 
with a focus on free cash flow, return on invested capital and earnings durability. We are currently executing 
ahead of our three-year financial plan and are well positioned to achieve our 2024 earnings target of over $7 per 
share. On free cash flow, we introduced a new goal to generate over $10 billion of free cash flow from 2023 to 
2025. Strong cash generation will enable us to return our balance sheet to investment grade metrics while 
consistently reinvesting in the business. 
 
In closing, thanks to the outstanding work of our people, Delta continues to set itself apart. We have unique 
opportunities to grow earnings by leveraging our powerful brand, extending our durable competitive advantages 
and accelerating our digital transformation. One other point I'd like to add. While our team has been hard at work 
returning the level of excellence to the skies that our customers deserve, we have not let go of our commitments 
to our community. Our team was recently recognized as the number one corporate blood drive donor to the 
American Red Cross for the sixth consecutive year with record units of blood collected. To me, these types of 
achievements are as rewarding as the great financial and operational results that we are publishing today and 
what makes this company truly great. 
 
Thank you again. And with that, let me turn the call over to Glen and Dan to go through the details of the quarter.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 13-Jul-2023 
 
Thank you, Ed, and good morning. I want to start by recognizing our people for their exceptional work during the 
always challenging peak summer travel period. Thank you. Delta produced record June quarter revenue of $14.6 
billion, up 19% over last year. Revenues were ahead of our initial expectations with momentum in June. June 30 
was a new record for industry volume and our highest summer revenue day in history. 
 
Total unit revenues were up 1.3% over prior year on improved yield and load factor. Consumer demand strength 
continues to be the primary driver of our revenue growth. Business travel in the quarter improved year-over-year, 
primarily driven by international. Overall, international passenger revenue grew 61%, led by the Transatlantic and 
Latin America. Domestic passenger revenue was 8% higher on a similar capacity increase. Premium revenue 
grew 25%, supporting growth in unit revenues and continuing to outperform main cabin. 
 
Delta Premium Select is now offered on over 80% of our wide-body fleet, and customer response to the product 
has been terrific with returns outpacing our expectations. Total loyalty revenue was up 20% versus last year with 
continued momentum in our American Express co-brand portfolio. Remuneration of $1.7 billion was 22% higher 
year-over-year. With $3.4 billion through the first half, we are firmly on track to exceed the $6.5 billion target for 
this year and focused on reaching our new long-term goal of $10 billion. 
 
Turning to the outlook, for September quarter, we expect total revenue to be similar to 2Q, increasing 11% to 14% 
year-over-year. On capacity outlook of 16% growth, unit revenues are expected to be 2% to 4% lower. While a 
deceleration from the June quarter, this is consistent with historic performance between 2Q and 3Q when 
factoring in the holiday shifts and tougher international comps as we lap the removal of restrictions. 
 
Domestically, demand remains robust and our core hub rebuild is advancing, with growth focused in Atlanta. In 
our coastal hubs, we are leveraging facility investments and progressively improving margins. On international, 
demand strength is continuing and we are confident in delivering record profitability and margins across all three 
international entities. System bookings for travel beyond Labor Day are encouraging into the fall. On corporate, 
we expect steady improvement in demand. Our recent corporate survey shows businesses expect to increase 
travel in the second half, with several of the least recovered sectors conveying optimism for increased travel in the 
fall. 
 
Similar optimism was reflected in Morgan Stanley's recent Global Corporate Travel Survey, where respondents 
indicated travel was expected to grow 9% year-over-year in the second half and 8% into 2024. Delta's capacity 
growth will normalize to mid single-digits in 2024, enabling us to further improve reliability, optimize the network 
and drive efficiency to reduce unit costs and support margin expansion. 
 
With an integrated and proven commercial strategy and the best people in the industry, we have significant 
opportunity ahead. In closing, I'm so proud of the team for delivering a great first half of the year and excited 
about the momentum we are building. 
 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan to talk about the financials. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. 

Great. Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. In the June quarter, we delivered earnings of $2.68 per 
share and an operating margin of 17%, ahead of our guidance and a significant improvement over last year. Our 
non-fuel unit costs were up 2.4% year-over-year. Fuel prices for the quarter averaged $2.52 per gallon, including 
a refinery benefit of $0.04. We generated operating cash flow of $2.6 billion, and after reinvesting $1.6 billion into 
the business, free cash flow was $1.1 billion.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 13-Jul-2023 
 
 
Liquidity ended the quarter at $8.8 billion, with adjusted net debt of $19.8 billion. During the first half of 2023, we 
repaid $3 billion of debt, including $1.4 billion of early repayments with a focus on our high-cost debt. For the 
year, we expect to repay over $4 billion of gross debt, resulting in interest costs over $100 million lower than our 
initial expectations. Our leverage ratio improved to 3.2 times on a trailing 12-month basis, and this is down from 5 
times at the end of the year. During the quarter, we announced the reinstatement of a quarterly dividend, opening 
the shareholder base to yield-focused investors. 
 
Now, moving on to guidance for the September quarter and full year. We expect mid-teen operating margins and 
earnings of $2.20 to $2.50 per share in the September quarter. Non-fuel unit costs have reached an important 
inflection point. We expect non-fuel unit costs decline 1% to 3% year-over-year in the September quarter. This is 
consistent with our expectations for a low single-digit decline in the second half of 2023. 
 
Rebuild costs are substantially behind us and capacity is returning through our most efficient core hubs. July 
marks our peak ASM production for the year and capacity seasonally declining in the fall and winter. As our 
capacity growth normalizes, it enables our operating teams to drive efficiency. We have over $1 billion opportunity 
from initiatives across the enterprise as hiring and trainings slow and our workforce gains experience. Improving 
our non-fuel unit costs is an enterprise-wide priority and remains within our controls. 
 
On fuel, we expect the September quarter fuel price to be between $2.50 to $2.70 per gallon. This includes a 
$0.04 refinery benefit. As part of our routine maintenance done once every five years, the refinery will undergo a 
turnaround in mid-September that will continue through November. With production offline during this period, we 
expect the refinery to break-even during the second half of the year. 
 
With our second quarter performance and our third quarter outlook, we now expect the full year earnings to be $6 
to $7 per share and an operating margin greater than 12% and free cash flow of $3 billion. Delivering these 
financial results also positions us to reduce our leverage ratio to 3 times by the end of the year and significantly 
improve our return on invested capital. For the full year, we expect our return on invested capital to be 
approximately 14%, a 6-point improvement versus last year. 
 
In closing, we're ahead of plan in 2023, and in 2024 remain confident in delivering earnings per share of over $7 
per share while generating over $4 billion of free cash flow and achieving our investment grade metrics. As we 
shared at Investor Day, we see significant opportunities beyond 2024, as we build on the strength of the core 
airline, leverage our existing capital base to grow high-margin revenue streams and deliver durable earnings 
through a full economic cycle. We couldn't do this without the hard work of our employees, who are delivering for 
our customers every day. I'd like to thank the Delta people for all they do. 
 
Now, with that, I'd like to turn it back to Julie for Q&A.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 13-Jul-2023 
 
 

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION 
 
 
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Helane Becker from TD Cowen. 
Your line is live. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Helane Becker 
Analyst, TD Cowen Q 
Thanks very much, operator. Hi, team. Thanks for the time here. I just have a point of clarification and then my 
question. The point of clarification is, Dan, did you just say that you're going to do more than $4 billion in free cash 
flow for this year and is that an official guidance update? And then, my question really has to do with, as you think 
about your digital footprint and the technology investments that you have to make, how are you thinking about 
what's customer-facing versus what's back-office and the cost to invest in both? Thank you. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
I'll start with the first one. And as it relates to free cash flow for this year, 2023, at Investor Day, we [ph] raised our 
guidance (00:17:21) from $2 billion to $3 billion. $3 billion is the number for this year, and we expect as part of our 
three-year plan, we said that we'd be at $4 billion or greater in 2024. And Ed talked about the three-year collective 
plan that we're working towards, which is over $10 billion for the cumulative period of 2023 through 2025. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
And Helane, on your question regarding digital, I think I mentioned a couple of weeks ago at our Investor Day, I 
consider this one of the most important activities and investments that we are making in the company. On the one 
hand, we're far along. We've been working on this for a while. But clearly, we have a lot to go as well. And most of 
the work that we are doing is clearly within the run rate, our CapEx run rate. I don't anticipate any increase in 
capital as a result of that. If anything, a lot of the work that we should start sun-setting by the end of 2024 in terms 
of moving our infrastructure to the cloud will start to dissipate, and that'll create even more capacity within the 
existing spend level for digital. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Helane Becker 
Analyst, TD Cowen Q 
Thank you. That's very helpful. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  
 

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Ravi Shanker 
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q 
Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Glen, you commented on the fall. Any chance you can expand on those 
comments a little bit more, especially US domestic? I think you spoke about corporate a little bit. I think most folks 
are focused on what the demand looks like beyond the summer, which is obviously very, very strong right now.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 13-Jul-2023 
 
Right. We see strong demand both domestically and internationally as far as we can see, and we can see 
internationally probably to the end of summer IATA in October and see very, very strong results there. And 
domestically, we've seen some very positive trends. I think that was one of our increases in the June quarter we 
talked about in the earnings, and we've seen some inflection in terms of [ph] close-in build (00:19:36) where it's 
starting to look better as we move later in the summer, and we're very encouraged with those trends as well. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Ravi Shanker 
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q 
Great. And as a follow-up maybe to Ed or Dan kind of you're going to hit your long-term EPS target of $7 at the 
high-end of your guide, this year, which obviously is very, very impressive. But I think – what's the next bar here 
or what's the next step? Are you looking at $10? I mean, obviously, [ph] you just gave us kind of the long-term 
outlook at the beyond (00:20:02) Analyst Day in terms of initiatives out there. But what are we thinking in terms of 
kind of financial targets for the long-term? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Hi, Ravi. We're going to – we need to get to $7 first before we talk about what's next. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
We're only halfway through our three-year plan. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah. And we've already just increased the current year guide. We will most likely, some point next year, 
hopefully in the first half of the year, have our updated long-term plan conversation, where we can talk about 
where we see the long-term financial targets for the company going. But right now, we want to focus on – we're in 
a very busy part of the year. We want to deliver a great operation for our customers, and we'll talk more over the 
course of the next 12 months as to how far the EPS can get. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Ravi Shanker

It's a very high-quality problem to have. Thanks, all.

 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Catherine O'Brien 
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q 
Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time. So, yesterday, we had a pretty sizable month-over-month 
step-down in airfare CPI. I did some quick analysis that shows that that data isn't very correlated to the industry's 
RASM or yield historically, but it doesn't feel quite right to fully ignore a data point like that. I guess did you see 
anything similar to that step-down in your own data, maybe on domestic or lower end of the fare spectrum? I

know you're guiding to a decel in 3Q versus 2Q, better than what myself and the Street was forecasting, but a 
deceleration. Is it as simple as that or are there flaws in how that CPI data is calculated where it's relevant to 
Delta? Thanks. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, the methodology is a sample of a sample. And so, we're not seeing same, and it's a different data point than 
what we have and what we're seeing. So, I'll leave it to that. If you want the definition, which I think explains why 
there may be a big variance to what you're seeing, we can forward that to you. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yes. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Catherine O'Brien 
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q 
Great. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah. One thing for the call, because I know a lot of people had this question. Just think about where we were 
last May and June. Demand had just turned on in a crazy-hot way. Supply was really low. People didn't care 
where they were going or how much they spent. They just wanted to go someplace, and we were seeing fares of 
up 30%, 40%, 50% in a lot of – particularly in a lot of the domestic markets where they could travel to. That's 
obviously not sustainable, and that's the comp set that you – it's in the data that's being compared to as well. So, 
we're now at a much more normalized level of stability in the fare environment, particularly domestically. And I 
think that it's really a poor comparison to try to draw what that one CPI print was off of a survey of a survey and 
how that relates to Delta for the future. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Catherine O'Brien 
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q 
I very much agree. Maybe one more for Dan too. Dan, you're well on your way on your $3 billion free cash flow 
target. Understand fuel has been volatile. Let's see how the ATL shapes up in the back half of the year. But if your 
free cash flow was to come in better, would there be upside to that $4 billion-plus debt pay-down you spoke to? Is 
that at all capped by your level of prepayable debt or you're happy to pay prepayment penalties if it means you 
take down that interest cost burden faster [indiscernible] (00:23:33) business? Thanks for all the time. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Certainly. As we've talked about, paying down debt is a priority here, generating cash, paying down debt, the two 
hand-to-hand. Any additional cash that we generate, we certainly would pay down debt with it. I think you'll see us 
– even in the back half of this year, we will be over that $4 billion that I talked about of gross debt pay-down. And

 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Michael Linenberg 
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q 
Yeah. Hey. I just want to touch back on I think, Ed, you talked about summer being strong. Maybe Glen also 
added to it for international – wait, not summer, but international being strong, extending into the fall. And I did 
note that for many of your seasonal European markets, it does look like you've extended the season into 
November, December, and instead of restarting in April or May, it seems like they're coming back in early March 
or maybe even February. 
 
Is there a secular shift that is going on here where you're just picking up more and more international? It's a 
longer season. Maybe these markets are becoming more mature on one hand. And my follow-up would be when 
you look at your domestic, what's the load factor points that are being driven by international? Is it 5 points of 
load, 8 points of load factor that are on a connecting itinerary? Thanks for answering my questions. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Sure. On the seasonality, we have extended – a lot of those seasonal deferrals were because of the way we did 
maintenance in the past, and we're adjusting that. I think what we want to accomplish for most of our markets is at 
least a full season of summer IATA, which is of course [indiscernible] (00:25:32). So, you've seen a lot of 
extensions into that period. 
 
We've seen travel patterns emerging post-pandemic to Europe that tend to see that Southern Europe has a 
longer season than it has had historically. And so, we're taking advantage of that, while Northern Europe does 
have a much shorter season, and so trying to work both of those issues to create a network that produces the 
best returns on a year-round basis. And we have a lot of improvement. We're going to have a really great 
summer, and our goal is to have a great winter as well. So, that's [indiscernible] (00:26:11). 
 
And on the domestic portion of international journey, I think in the last call, we said it was about 10%, and I think 
that's about where it's staying. And again, that depends whether you call domestic portion of international journey 
to the long-hauls or to the short-haul including the Caribbean and Mexico. And so, the number I'm giving you 
includes the Caribbean and Mexico, which is really part of North America. If you took the truly long-hauls out of 
that, it would be a lower number.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 13-Jul-2023 
 
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Your line is live. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Sheila Kahyaoglu 
Analyst, Jefferies LLC Q 
Thank you. Good morning, guys. And great quarter on profitability. You raised the margin guidance for the year 
with 12% for 2023. That implies 100 basis points of improvement in the second half. How much of that is coming 
from fuel and non-fuel costs? You mentioned that down 1 to 3 points. Is it all just cost benefits or are you 
assuming some continued [ph] yield strength in the Atlantic (00:27:12) like we were just talking about and benefit 
from domestic hub restorations? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah. When you think about it first half to second half, couple of things to think about. Certainly, non-fuel is the 
biggest driver there. We were up in the first half from a down low single-digits in the back half. That's your real 
benefit related to that on that basis. The other benefit you have is when you think about the halves, you really 
have a [ph] second quarter (00:27:38) pretty similar, where you have a fourth quarter versus a first quarter 
performance in that half performance. And when you put all that together, that also drives that margin 
performance first half versus second half. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Sheila Kahyaoglu 
Analyst, Jefferies LLC Q 
Great. Thank you. And then, if I could just ask a follow-up on cash. The CapEx assumption, does it still remain 
$5.5 billion? And should we think about the skyline at 43 aircraft for the year, given you mentioned some delivery 
constraints? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yes. We've held our – even as we updated our free cash flow for the year from $2 billion to $3 billion, we've held 
our CapEx at $5.5 billion. We're still holding right around that 42, 43 aircrafts for the year. That can always move 
around as it has here by a few.

Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Glen, you said that the third quarter RASM would have been in line with seasonality 
if you make a few adjustments. Can you just maybe give a little bit of color on the adjustments you're sort of 
thinking about? And then, just – I don't know if I heard it yet, so, maybe just share domestic versus international 
RASM expectations for the third quarter.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 13-Jul-2023 
 
Yeah. On the seasonality between 2Q and 3Q, we had some of the days shift. The outbound 4th of July was in 
2Q, which is some of the best days of summer, as we pointed out in this. So, if you take that and adjust for that, 
we're about 1 point off than normal, and hopefully, we can make that 1 point up in the quarter. But if you look back 
to last year, I think that's the more important comp when you see the deceleration from [ph] 1 point to – on a 
midpoint of minus 3% (00:29:24). 
 
Last year's international RASM went – between 2Q and 3Q, was up 16 points, as the restrictions – travel 
restrictions went off in 2Q. So, that had that big surge in demand on a limited capacity last year. So, I think we're 
really – we're looking at a 2Q to 3Q that's really right in line with what we think the seasonal norms are. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Scott H. Group 
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC Q 
Okay, helpful. And then, Dan, I don't know if I'm getting a little ahead of myself. But when I think about the 
inflection in CASM in the back half this year, that's still with a pilot deal. So, as we look ahead to next year, I know 
you've already said down low single-digits, but am I wrong in thinking that the first half is going to be better than 
that? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, the pilot deal you have throughout this year. And as we've talked about, you have it in every quarter and it's 
about 4 points, along with the wage increase overall for the entire Delta workforce that came through for the year. 
 
When you think about next year and you think about [ph] the (00:30:33) what we've talked about as the low 
single-digits, really [ph] we're out there (00:30:36) with mid single-digit capacity growth, you get that benefit. And 
then, as you get into the scale and efficiency on rebuild, that is another element that we'll benefit from. So, you get 
efficiency, you won't have the repeat of the rebuild that we had this year, and then the offset to that is the 
continued movement as it relates to a couple of points when you think about pilots and wages into next year. And 
that's what gets you to low single-digits is the general framework associated with the drivers there. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Scott H. Group

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Your line is live. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Jamie N. Baker 
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q 
Hey. Good morning. So, Glen, does your third quarter RASM guide assume any share pick-up at the expense of 
any competitors that may be alternating their distribution strategy or rethinking their Northeast footprint? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
There's two questions in there, and the first question is, I think, our third quarter is based on what we see in the 
second quarter and moving forward and there haven't been any changes to distribution strategies in the quarter. 
So, I'd say it's what we see today, just moving forward from there. And on the cessation of the NEA, listen, we 
compete well in New York. We've had a long history of competing well in New York, and we're really confident on

that – as it evolves, that we'll be able to continue to win in New York, which has been our long-term strategy for 10 
years, and we're not deviating from that, so. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Jamie N. Baker 
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q 
Thank you. And on the corporate survey work, any shifts in how individual sectors are responding? For example, 
is the messaging from your tech customers unchanged from what it's been, that sort of thing? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
No, I think we pointed out that the laggards are the ones that are most encouraged as you get to the fall. And I 
think Ed's always said, and I agree with him 100%, that propensity to travel is directly related to whether or not 
you're in the office. And as we see more and more offices trying to reopen or reopening and people trying to get 
back into – the corporations trying to get people back in the office, I think that's a great constructive backdrop for 
us as we head into the fall and the post Labor Day period. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Jamie N. Baker 
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q 
That's great. Thanks for... 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Jamie, I'd like to add one additional comment there. All these comparisons in terms of corporate travel 
unfortunately are still all made to 2019. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Jamie N. Baker 
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q 
Yeah. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
And we lose sight of the fact that our economy is 20% plus or minus larger than it was in 2019. So, what you're 
talking about actually is there is a lot of room to improve for corporate America on travel, and I think that's part of 
the underpinning why we think there's going to – you're going to continue to see some steady improvement here 
this fall, and you're hearing it from the travel managers as well. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 13-Jul-2023 
 
Hi, everyone. Thank you. Just to follow up on Jamie's question, so you do sound a bit better on corporate travel 
recovering in the back half. But I'm just – like just to be clear, is that in your guide or is that additional upside if 
those things do come in a little bit better? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
We have a continuous slow and steady build in our guide. If it was to accelerate beyond what it's been doing, that 
would be upside. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Conor Cunningham 
Analyst, Melius Research LLC Q 
Okay. That's helpful. And then, just on the domestic RASM, I think you guys are going to be one of the best in the 
industry, if not the best. I was just curious if you could unpack what was the outperformance. Is that purely just 
your core hub rebuild and coastal investments kind of coming in at higher unit revenues? Just trying to 
understand, maybe back to Catie's question, like the differences between regular economy seats and what Delta 
kind of offers out there. Thank you. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, I think we said that it's been continuing to be led by premium products and services, and that our domestic 
rebuild has, as we've spoken about earlier, initially focused on the coastal gateways and right now moving back 
into the core. And so, we have the lapping of the investments we made in the coastal gateways coming out of 
COVID now producing very good returns for us, as well as the investments in the core, which of course come in at 
higher unit revenues. So, I think it's a combination of those two factors moving together.

Savanthi Syth 
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Q 
Hey. Good morning. Just curious on the international capacity. It's been growing at a faster pace than domestic, 
given that that's where the restoration has been to a greater degree. I was curious like how long you expect 
international capacity growth to kind of continue to outpace domestic here? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, as capacity trends down as we head out of restoration into a more normal growth cycle, I think you'll see a 
pretty even distribution between domestic and international as we head into 2024. We really haven't given any 
guidance on that yet, and internally, we haven't even completed our 2024 plan yet. But I would expect it to be very 
similar split between domestic and international.

Got it. And if I might just ask on the Latin entity, Glen, just could you provide a little bit more color on what you're 
seeing, especially broken out between kind of near international, which recovered first, and kind of the South 
America markets? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah. Of course, we've been really thrilled with the results with LATAM and the improvements in our South 
America revenue base. So, South America is moving at a great clip, and again, the short and medium-haul Latin 
America markets were some of the first to recover and they're still continuing to be strong, but not posting those 
great giant gains they did in the early part of the recovery.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is

 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Duane Pfennigwerth 
Analyst, Evercore ISI Q 
Hey. Good morning and congrats on these strong results. On your Transatlantic JV, I just wondered if there is any 
new approaches, maybe any learnings through the pandemic that will change the way you operate going forward 
versus maybe what you've done in the past, how much each side flies, things like that. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
We have a great Transatlantic joint venture. It was the first one and the most integrated and one that we think has 
huge customer benefits. And it's always evolving, and that's the great – and we have great partners that want it to 
evolve. So, we're continuing evaluating how we approach the marketplace together. You've seen some swaps 
from the fall from things that we have flown to things that our partners are now going to fly. And so, I don't think 
there are any huge headline changes, but it's always evolving. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Duane Pfennigwerth 
Analyst, Evercore ISI Q 
Okay. And then, maybe just for my follow-up on seasonally shaping capacity. It looks like nominally, ASMs peak 
in July. They step down a little bit in August, and they step down a little bit again in September, which seems to 
make some sense. Not all your peers are kind of taking that approach. In some cases, August is bigger than July, 
et cetera. So, is this just getting back to kind of your view on normal seasonality or is this more operationally 
driven? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
No. Absolutely, it's more normal seasonality. Of course, in the South, you have the schools going back earlier and 
earlier. This year, for example, schools go back in Georgia the 1st of August. And so, we're through the summer 
travel period in the South, whereas the North tends to go back after Labor Day. So, if you look more granularly, 
you'd see the Southern – the Atlanta hub and the South trends down in the second half of August, and we keep

the Northern tier operating a little bit longer and then pull that down after Labor Day. So, we are actually getting 
much more back to where we want to be, as we say we come out of restoration to a much more normal 
seasonality.

 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Brandon R. Oglenski 
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Q 
Hey. Thanks for letting me ask one here. Glen, so I guess the – and I know we're not guiding to 4Q here, but 
implied revenue in 4Q maybe feels a little bit softer from 3Q for the full year – just given your full year guidance, 
sorry. Is that conservatism around the off-peak periods like [ph] what you're (00:39:49) talking about back in 1Q 
with booking trends that have just changed and cancel fees that – or the lack of cancel fees that have changed 
consumer behavior? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah. I just think we know the least about 4Q right now. And so, as we get towards the end of this quarter, I think 
we'll have a much better view that we could share with you on the October call. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Brandon R. Oglenski 
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Q 
Okay. I appreciate that. But I guess can you talk maybe structurally, how are you approaching the off-peak period 
differently than earlier this year? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, I think what we have left to go in the year is we have to get through Labor Day, of course, and I think we 
have good visibility through Labor Day. Then, we have October, which is historically a very strong travel month for 
business, so, we'll see how that unfolds. And then, we have the holidays, which are the peak holidays. That's all 
that's really left in the year, and we have good bookings for the holidays. We have good visibility on that. So, it's 
really going to depend on – and I think it's potential upside, as you said earlier, is does business travel return 
more than we expect. And if so, then we have some good upside for the back half of the year. If not, we're going 
to trend where we see today.

Journal. Your line is live. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Alison Sider 
Reporter, The Wall Street Journal Q 
Hey. Thanks so much. Yeah. I wanted to ask about Viasat yesterday reported it had a deployment issue with its 
recently launched satellite. Just curious if that causes any potential problems for Delta's free Wi-Fi plans, either 
for what's currently in place or for the future roll-outs, and if you have to consider any kind of alternatives? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Hi, Aly. Obviously, we were disappointed, as Viasat was, with the news yesterday, but we're committed long-term 
and they will get through this. We see no meaningful impact to where we stand currently with our domestic 
capacity, and we're working closely with them to make sure the domestic performance maintains what we've been 
seeing, which has been great. I think if anything, it may cause a delayed roll-out on some of the international 
markets. But it's too early to tell. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Alison Sider 
Reporter, The Wall Street Journal Q 
Okay. Thanks. And I also wanted to see if Delta has any view on some of the proposals that Congress is 
considering around simulator training counting towards pilot experience hours, if that's something you view 
favorably or if Delta would have any plans to offer a training program of its own if the Senate proposal goes 
through or how you're thinking about that. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Peter W. Carter 
Executive Vice President-External Affairs, Chief Legal Officer & Corporate Secretary, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Hey, Alison. It's Peter. Delta has not weighed in on those particular proposals. We think the way pilots are trained 
is obviously incredibly effective and it's important to maintain those type of training requirements.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 13-Jul-2023 
 
Leslie Josephs 
Reporter, CNBC Q 
Hi. Good morning, everyone. Also wondering if Delta has any view on raising the pilot age potentially to 67, if not 
beyond that, at some point. And then also with the affirmative action ruling from last month, is Delta reviewing or 
looking at its current DEI policies and expecting any changes that it has to make? Thanks. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Leslie, I'll take the first. No, we don't have a point of view on that. I think that's something that – within the pilot 
community, there's a lot of different opinions around. So, we'll stand by and observe and watch how that 
discussion unfolds. Peter will touch on the affirmative action.

Peter W. Carter 
Executive Vice President-External Affairs, Chief Legal Officer & Corporate Secretary, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A

don't have an affirmative action program at Delta. We always hire the very best.

Mary Schlangenstein 
Reporter, Bloomberg News Q 
Hi. Good morning. Thank you. With your expectation that the corporate travel recovery is going to slowly continue 
during the fall, will that step-up enough that it'll make up for any decline in leisure travel after schools return or do 
you not expect to see that historical dip in leisure travel this fall? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, I'd just give you a view of what we do see, because domestic demands, of course, come a little bit later on. 
But for international travel post Labor Day, we see very robust leisure demand continuing through the October 
period. And so, combine that with – hopefully, we'll get some upside surprise on the increase in business, but 
we're not really counting on anything more than what we see today.

Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. I wondered if Delta has any contingency planning or views
