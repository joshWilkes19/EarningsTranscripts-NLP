Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Delta Air Lines June Quarter 2024 Financial Results 
Conference Call. My name is Matthew, and I'll be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only

Julie Stewart 
Vice President-Investor Relations, Delta Air Lines 

Thank you, Matthew. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our June Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. 
Joining us from Atlanta today are CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Dan Janki. Ed 
will open the call with an overview of Delta's performance and strategy. Glen will provide an update on the 
revenue environment, and Dan will discuss costs and our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we'll take 
analyst questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up so that we can get 
to as many of you as possible. And after the analyst Q&A, we'll move to our media questions. 
 
Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future 
events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ 
materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are 
described in Delta's SEC filings. 
 
We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and all results exclude special items, unless otherwise noted. 
You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. 
 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to the Ed.

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. 

Well, thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Earlier this morning, we 
reported our June quarter results, posting pre-tax earnings of $2 billion, or $2.36 per share on record quarterly 
revenue, up 5.4% over last year. These results are the second highest quarterly earnings in our history. We 
achieved a 15% operating margin and generated $1.3 billion of free cash during the quarter, bringing our first half 
free cash flow to $2.7 billion. 
 
With strong cash generation, we continued to progress our balance sheet back towards investment-grade metrics 
and announced a 50% increase to our quarterly dividend. We delivered a return on invested capital of 13%, 5 
points above our cost of capital and in the top half of the S&P 500. 
 
Delta's leadership is increasingly being recognized alongside some of the world's best companies. Just last 
month, Delta was ranked fourth in the Fortune 500 ReturnOnLeadership by Fortune and Indiggo, just behind 
NVIDIA and Microsoft.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 11-Jul-2024 
 
Through the year, our teams have delivered industry-leading operational performance month in and month out, 
with Delta leading across all key metrics, including completion factor, on-time departures and arrivals. This 
performance builds on our long-standing position as the most reliable airline in the US, and I'd like to thank all 
100,000 members of our team for their exceptional work taking care of our customers each and every day. They 
are truly the best in the business. 
 
Recognizing the extraordinary skill and care of our people, Delta was named the 2024 Global Airline of the Year 
by Air Transport World at the recent IATA Annual Meeting, and for the sixth year in a row, The Points Guy ranked 
Delta as the best US airline. Delta was also recently named the top-ranked carrier across all premium cabins in 
J.D. Power's North American Airline Satisfaction Study. 
 
Sharing our success with our people is core to our culture, and we are at the forefront on total rewards for our 
employees. We provided a 5% pay raise on the 1st of June to eligible employees, and we have accrued more 
than $640 million in profit sharing through the first half of the year. I am confident our profit-sharing payout next 
February will continue to lead the industry by a wide margin. 
 
Our people are the foundation that enables Delta to deliver elevated experiences to our customers. To further 
differentiate our service excellence, we are making high-return investments that make travel more seamless and 
connected, including generational airport rebuilds, the most comprehensive lounge network in the industry, 
expanded premium offerings, and fast free Wi-Fi on-board. Just a few weeks ago, we opened our new Delta One 
Lounge in JFK, the first of its kind. It offers a variety of world-class amenities for our customers from fine dining to 
spa treatments. And later this year, we'll open Delta One Lounges in Boston and Los Angeles and in Seattle early 
next year. We're also enhancing existing Delta Sky Clubs with the recent expansion of the Miami and LaGuardia 
clubs. 
 
On-board, we have upgraded service in our Delta Premium Select cabin and will expand this popular product to 
select transcontinental flights this fall. We recently released the most comprehensive refresh of the Fly Delta app 
in the last five years. Updates to the app added new features and functionality to save customers' time and 
manage their travel even when the unexpected happens. Since the launch, a record number of customers have 
visited the app, with self-service usage during periods of disruption up 5 full points, improving the customer 
experience. 
 
And more and more customers are joining our SkyMiles loyalty program and deepening engagement beyond 
flight, with about 30% of our active members carrying a Delta SkyMiles American Express credit card in their 
wallet. New card acquisitions are skewing younger and the overall portfolio continues to shift to a more premium 
mix, positioning us well to achieve our long-term remuneration goal of $10 billion. 
 
Finally, just this week, we were excited to announce an exclusive partnership with Riyadh Air, a new global carrier 
that will begin service in Saudi Arabia next year. Riyadh Air will be the premier international airline for Saudi 
Arabia and this partnership will expand connectivity and premium travel options for both airlines across North 
America, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and beyond. 
 
The agreement comes amid large scale investments in the region that are rapidly transforming the Kingdom of 
Saudi Arabia into a popular destination for leisure and business travel, with tremendous opportunity for growth. 
 
All of our continued investments across the travel ribbon strengthen Delta's trusted brand and build on our long-
term journey to elevate the travel experience and increase our financial durability.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 11-Jul-2024 
 
Delta's industry leadership has never been greater, and while demand for air travel remains strong with record 
TSA travel volumes up 7% from last year's levels, domestic industry seat growth has accelerated through the 
summer months, impacting yield performance in the main cabin. 
 
As the carrier of choice with a diversified revenue base, Delta is the most insulated from this dynamic. We are 
delivering double-digit margins and strong returns in this environment, with Delta expected to generate 50% of the 
industry's profitability in the first half of the year, despite only representing 20% of the market capacity. 
 
That said, we are encouraged by the actions the industry has taken. Seat growth is decelerating, and there 
appears to be increased focus on improving financial performance. While our returns are strong, I'm confident that 
we'll see an even more constructive industry backdrop through the back half of the year and into 2025. 
 
Turning to our outlook, travel remains a top purchase priority and Delta's core customers are in a healthy position. 
The secular shift in consumer spend to prioritize experiences align perfectly with Delta's strategy and premium 
focus across our global network. Air travel demand is at record levels, with this past Sunday marking Delta's 
highest ever summer revenue day. 
 
For the September quarter, we expect continued demand strength, a double-digit operating margin, and a pre-tax 
profit of approximately $1.5 billion. Glen and Dan will provide more details on our third quarter outlook. 
 
With strong first half performance and good visibility into the second half, we remain confident in our full year 
guidance for earnings at $6 to $7 per share, free cash flow of $3 billion to $4 billion, and leverage of 2.5 times. 
 
In closing, as we approach our 100th year anniversary in 2025, Delta is in a stronger position than ever before. 
Our industry-leading performance reflects the strength of Delta's differentiated brand and returns-focused 
strategy. And with our clear prioritization of free cash flow and debt reduction, Delta is exceptionally well-
positioned to deliver significant shareholder value. 
 
We look forward to sharing more about our long-term strategic and financial goals at our upcoming Investor Day 
in New York this November. Thank you, again. 
 
And with that, let me hand it over to Glen for more details on our commercial performance. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. 

Thank you, Ed, and good morning. I want to start by thanking our employees for their hard work and dedication. 
They are the Delta difference. 
 
Revenue for the June quarter increased 5.4% year over year to a record $15.4 billion. Total unit revenue was 
down 2.6% compared to last year, below our guidance due to three dynamics. First, domestic industry seat 
growth accelerated into the summer months beyond normal demand growth. This has impacted main cabin unit 
revenue trends through the summer. With scheduled seat growth decelerating into the fall, June and July will be 
the low point, with unit revenue trends expected to significantly improve in August and beyond. 
 
Second, we are seeing about a $100 million impact on travel to Paris for the Olympics from June to August. 
Outside of this temporary event, summer travel demand to Europe is strong and consistent with our expectations.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 11-Jul-2024 
 
And lastly, as Ed noted, we ran a great operation with a high completion factor. Premium continued to outperform 
and differentiate our results. Premium revenue was up 10% over prior year, with positive unit revenue growth. We 
have runway ahead as we continue adding more premium seats to our aircraft, improving our retailing 
capabilities, and further segmenting our products. 
 
Loyalty has also outperformed, with revenue up 8% as our SkyMiles member base continues to expand. Spend 
growth in our co-brand card portfolio is expected to continue outpacing the credit card industry. American Express 
remuneration for the quarter was $1.9 billion, up 9% year over year. 
 
Cargo revenue was 16% higher than the previous year, a significant improvement from the last 12 months, and 
we are encouraged by the trends we're seeing. Diverse revenue streams generated 56% of total revenue. These 
valuable revenue streams led by premium and loyalty are continuing higher growth and margins, underpinning 
Delta's industry-leading financial performance and increasing our financial durability. 
 
Domestic passenger revenue was up 5% over the prior year and international passenger revenue grew up 4% 
over last year's record June quarter. As the business carrier of choice, Delta benefited from double-digit volume 
growth in this high-value segment with broad demand and growth across all sectors. 
 
Looking forward, demand for travel on Delta remains robust. Our core customer base is healthy, and demand for 
premium products continues to outperform the main cabin. We expect the strong growth in business travel to 
continue, with 90% of companies in our recent corporate survey saying they intend to maintain or increase travel 
volumes in the back half of the year. 
 
International demand is strong and continues to benefit from demographic shifts, US point-of-sale changes, and 
an extension of the leisure travel season. As our international network and core hubs approach full restoration 
and we return to a more normal cadence of retiring aircraft, Delta's capacity growth decelerates into the second 
half of the year. 
 
For the September quarter, we expect capacity growth of 5% to 6% and revenue growth of 2% to 4%. Total unit 
revenue is expected to sequentially improve each month. In domestic, we expect an inflection to positive unit 
revenue growth in the month of September. We also expect Transatlantic unit revenue trends to improve into the 
fall. And in Latin America, we expect unit revenue trends to progressively improve through the back half of the 
year. 
 
Lastly, in the Pacific, we are continuing to restore our network and are very pleased with the early results from our 
new service to Taipei and the success of our partnership with Korean Air. Pacific margins are sustaining at a 
meaningfully higher level than pre-pandemic due to our multi-year restructuring, driving sustainable profitability. 
 
For the full year, we expect to deliver a sustained unit revenue premium, double-digit margins, and returns well in 
excess of our cost of capital. Our ability to deliver these outstanding results, while the industry works to 
reestablish equilibrium, reflects Delta's growing differentiation and leadership. 
 
In closing, I want to congratulate the Delta team for an outstanding first half of 2024. We are well positioned to 
continue our momentum through the second half and for years to come. 
 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan to talk about the financials.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 11-Jul-2024 
 
Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. 

Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. For the June quarter, we delivered pre-tax income of $2 billion 
on a 15% operating margin. Earnings of $2.36 per share was in line with our guidance and in line with 2019 
despite fuel prices that were more than 25% higher. Non-fuel CASM was up 0.6% year over year, more than 1 
point better than guidance, primarily on stronger completion factor. 
 
A great operation is the foundation of a competitive cost structure, and in the June quarter, we delivered a 99.5% 
system completion factor, including 13 cancel-free, brand-perfect days. For the first half, Delta has delivered 39 
brand-perfect days, more than all of last year combined. 
 
Fuel prices averaged $2.64 per gallon for the quarter. This included a $0.06 benefit from a refinery profit of $60 
million. Fuel efficiency was 1.1% better than last year, benefiting from the continued renewal of our fleet and 
running a great operation. 
 
Operating cash flow in the first half was $4.9 billion. And after reinvesting $2.3 billion back into the business, we 
generated free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Strong cash generation has supported debt repayment of $2.1 billion 
year-to-date, including $900 million of early repayments. Gross leverage ended the quarter at 2.8 times. 
 
We remain on track to repay $4 billion of debt this year and are committed to further strengthening our balance 
sheet with a focus on returning to full investment grade. 
 
Delta is currently investment-grade rated at Moody's and BB+ at both S&P and Fitch, with all agencies with a 
positive outlook. With strong results and cash flow through the first half, we announced a 50% increase in our 
quarterly dividend. This puts our annualized dividend yield at just over 1%, in line with the S&P 500. 
 
Now, moving to the September quarter guidance, combined with our outlook for top line growth, we expect an 
operating margin of 11% to 13%, with earnings of $1.70 to $2 per share. Fuel prices are expected to be $2.60 to 
$2.80 per gallon, including an approximately $0.05 contribution from the refinery. Refinery margins have 
normalized and profits are expected to be $60 million lower compared to the third quarter of last year. 
 
Non-fuel unit costs are expected to be 1% to 2% higher than last year on 5% to 6% capacity growth. With 
normalized growth and consistency in delivering a great operation, we are making progress in driving efficiency 
and growing into our resources. 
 
On maintenance, the investment in fleet health we made since last summer are paying off, with maintenance 
cancelations in the first half down 77% over prior years. We continue to expect full year maintenance expense to 
be up $350 million over 2023 as we progress through elevated volume of heavy airframe and engine checks and 
continue to manage industry-wide supply constraints. The majority of this increase was in the first half of the year, 
with second half maintenance expense expected to be similar on a year-over-year basis. 
 
Total non-fuel unit costs in the second half are expected to increase in the low-single digits as we fund 
investments in our people and brand and capacity growth decelerates. 
 
For the year, our fleet growth is expected to be less than 2%, including approximately 40 aircraft deliveries and 20 
retirements. Our unencumbered asset base is expected to grow to $30 billion by year-end as we continue to pay 
cash for our new deliveries.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 11-Jul-2024 

We remain confident in our full year outlook of earnings of $6 to $7 per share and free cash flow of $3 billion to $4 
billion, with full year CapEx expected to be $5 billion. 

With the continued focus on margin and returns to drive sustained cash flow generation, Delta is well-positioned 
to improve our balance sheet to investment-grade metrics and deliver shareholder value. 

In closing, Delta's industry-leading performance is a direct result of the hard work of our employees. I want to 
thank the Delta people for continuing to go above and beyond for our customers and each other every day. 

And with that, I'll turn it back to Ed for a final remark. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. 

Thank you, Dan. And before we begin to Q&A, I want to personally recognize and congratulate Helane Becker on 
a very accomplished career as an analyst covering this industry for four decades. Helane, I have a great amount 
of respect for you and for all the work that you've done through the years. And while I know you'll be continuing in 
an advisory role, we will miss working with you and wish you all the best. May the golf gods be good to you. 

Operator, please begin the Q&A. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION 

Operator: Certainly. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] 
Your first question is coming from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Your line is live. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Conor Cunningham 
Analyst, Melius Research LLC Q 
Hi, everyone. Thank you. And yeah, congrats, Helane. Good luck on the golf game. In terms of the comment on 
September for the US domestic market, can you just help bridge the gap there? My guess is that you're pretty 
minimally booked for September, so is it just an industry supply getting better? Just given the discounting that's 
happening right now, it's just a little hard to wrap my head around, so just any thoughts there would be helpful. 
Thank you. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Sure, Conor. I wouldn't say we are minimally booked. We probably have about a third of September bookings 
domestically on hand, so we have a good base. And the base we have is substantially better than the base we 
had going into July and August at minus 60 days. So, we see a much better base. And then, of course, the core 
economics of the industry's capacity coming – continuing to come down and going back into a more normalized 
business season, where business tends to pick up from August to September. 

So, I think when you think about one of our core strengths being business, July and August, that's not ever been 
peak for business, so as we move back into the business season, given the trends we've seen in business 
demand, we think that'll be another uplift. So, really confident about our September numbers and really confident 
that not only is domestically improving substantially but international is also improving dramatically.

Conor Cunningham 
Analyst, Melius Research LLC Q 
Helpful. And then maybe bigger picture, the issue that we've been grappling with is just like the overall structure of 
the industry over the next couple years. I get the idea that the current state of industry margins need to change 
outside of you and United, but can you just give us how confident are you that there will actually be structural 
changes going forward? Because the pushback we get is that this is kind of just the same old industry that just 
continues to oversupply the market from time to time, so just any thoughts on the bigger industry picture there? 
Thank you. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, I'll just – I'll comment on the capacity and then let Ed take the broader question. On capacity, I do think, 
listen, this is an industry that's always challenging itself for how much capacity can it be in the marketplace. And 
I've been doing this for 40 years and I've never seen the industry react so quickly to an oversupply. So, we've 
really only been in an oversupply situation for a couple of months here and the industry's already reacted and I 
think that's very different than it was years ago, where it would stay for prolonged periods of time. So, I'm really 
excited about how the industry is behaving at this point. 
 
And for the broader question, I'll turn it back to Ed. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah, Conor, to Glen's point, the law of economics or physics, whatever you want to say, is going to have to work. 
You cannot – if you're on the lower end of the industry's food chain continue to post losses, particularly given the 
health of the demand set we've all seen over these last couple of years. So, I don't know what form that will take, 
but I guarantee you and you're already starting to see, capacity is usually the first thing that you – lever you have 
available but there will be more levers available as well. 
 
The health of the industry broadly is in pretty good shape. Now, I recognize what I just said, the lower half is 
struggling. But if you look at where we all need to go as an industry is that we need to continue to better 
differentiate and provide value to our customers. Value in this industry for many years was defined as having the 
lowest fare in the market. That's changed. That's changed dramatically. 
 
The experience economy that we've seen, that's taken hold, that's driven the high demand set that we are seeing 
and continue to see and even with the third quarter revenue "disappointment", it's still going to be record set of 
revenues that we're going to see this quarter, I'm convinced, across the industry is rewarding those that are 
providing real value, meaning a better quality experience, better value for money in terms of the product we're 
offering, and reliability. 
 
Couple that with the higher cost of entry, higher than we've ever seen, whether it's labor, whether it's the 
constraints in the environment, the infrastructure, OEM, engine supply, this is turning into an industry that is going 
to be needing to return its cost of capital or it will not be – those that don't will not be given the opportunity to 
continue to run the business models they have. 
 
So, I realize I'm talking my own book and I appreciate that there's a lot of other work that others need to lift. 
Listen, we're driving 50% of the overall industry profitability here at Delta. There's only so much more we can do 
on our own. And as things get better, Delta's only going to be a beneficiary.

Conor Cunningham

Great. Thank you. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  
 

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is live. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Savanthi Syth 
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Q 
Hey, good morning, everyone. Just, I think kind of the Boeing challenges are well understood, but the update from 
Airbus a few weeks ago was surprising. I wonder if you could talk about how you're managing through supply 
chain issues. And any early thoughts on how you're thinking things evolve in 2025 in terms of just managing the 
operation but also in terms of kind of planning for growth. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Savi, this is Ed. I'll take that. Airbus, like Boeing, continues to have certain delivery challenges, obviously nowhere 
close to the challenges that Boeing has experienced. And as one of Airbus' largest and best customers, Delta 
again is insulated somewhat from that. 
 
We're going to take largely the delivery schedule that we anticipated for the year. Yes, some may slip, but you're 
talking about slip meaning in terms of weeks and months, not years of delay. And as long as we have, as we do 
have, pretty good notice of where the delays in delivery are coming, we'll be just fine. In 2025, I don't anticipate us 
having any problems with the aircraft that we're going to need for the capacity we'd would like to fly. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Savanthi Syth 
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Q 
And I'm guessing then on an operational standpoint maybe not expecting any improvements either, just having 
just extra buffers will continue? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, we have a large fleet and our maintenance capabilities continue to improve. The challenge we face on the 
maintenance front tend to be more parts supply than anything else as well as the – all these new engine platforms 
that are out there from the GTF to the LEAP to the Trent stabilizing, but they continue to get better. And I think the 
opportunities for us, as things stabilize and as parts become more available and as new aircraft continue to 
deliver, will be for us to resume the retirement of our older fleet, which we indicated in the release we're already 
starting to do and which will create even more part availability back to our maintenance team. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Savanthi Syth 
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Q 
That's helpful. Thanks, Ed. And if I might, Glen, ask about on the LATAM side, you mentioned kind of encouraged 
by what you're seeing there. I was kind of curious on the unit revenue pressure, is that still coming from short haul 
with like in long haul still largely flattish even despite the growth, or how – and where are you expecting the 
improvement as you go through.

Actually, long haul south has inflected to positive and it's remaining solidly positive throughout the third quarter 
here, so we're pretty excited about those results. And, yes, still not lapping the reduction in capacity in the leisure 
short haul portfolio, but that is in play and it looks that the industry is going to be much more disciplined in terms 
of capacity levels this winter versus last winter. So, we're looking at really positive momentum of that moving 
forward and that continuing.

Jamie N. Baker 
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q 
Oh, good morning, everybody. So, Glen, this concept of unbundling the front cabin is one that I've been thinking 
about in part because unbundling and segmenting the rear cabin has been such a success for Delta and a few 
others. I want to be careful about asking about future pricing and all that, but I'm curious what the pros and cons 
are in terms of possibly going down this path, or is one price for all how we should continue to think about the [ph] 
D1 (00:29:32) cabin? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
I think you're going to have to come to Investor Day to hear more about that. We've talked conceptually about 
that. I think we'll be giving you more details as we get but we're not ready to talk about the details of those plans 
moving forward. I think Investor Day this year should be very exciting. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Jamie N. Baker 
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q 
I'm confident I will work it into my schedule. And then, maybe for Ed or for Glen, but at a high level, it seems that 
those airlines that are currently under duress are sort of beginning to lean into premium. And maybe premium is 
too strong of a term, but some of the more punitive ancillary charges, change fees are disappearing, there's an 
option of a empty middle seat, Southwest has said they're looking at some sort of enhancement to their product. 
I'm just curious if this is something you and the team think about. The conventional wisdom is that premium spoils 
belong to Delta, but what we're seeing today is that Delta is not entirely isolated from low-end overcapacity. I'm 
just thinking down the road if we could find Delta isn't as isolated from, let's call it, pseudo premium overcapacity. 
Any thoughts there? Thanks in advance. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, Jamie, that's a good question. It's certainly something that we all look at. Premium is more than just putting 
more seats – or excuse me, more room in seats, and it's the overall experience, right? And yes, I think all of those 
experiments that we hear about, some of the lower fare airlines or the discount airlines are considering, you can't 
blame them. I would, if I was them, consider some of those as well.

But premium is also based on a foundation of overall reliability and service, first and foremost. And that's what we 
have focused on and specialized and done better over the last 15 years than any airline and we continue to get 
better. In fact, the operations we've run this year are the best in the industry across every measure, every month, 
month in and month out. That gives you then freedom to actually deliver true premium experience as compared to 
somewhat maybe more superficial experience. 
 
And that to me is what we're best at. That's why business travelers choose Delta. That's why we have the 
opportunities internationally that we do. That's why American Express, the top credit card provider in the world, in 
my opinion, chooses Delta as their exclusive partner. 
 
So, I think there's room for more, and I would – the industry needs to continue to find better ways in which to 
manage the higher cost that they're facing. Remember, the cost to serve has gone up for everybody, but 
especially for the discounters, and the only way you can cover that is providing a better experience.

 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Thomas Fitzgerald 
Analyst, TD Securities (USA) LLC Q 
Hi, everyone. Thanks very much for the time. So, sticking with the premium cabin for a little bit, would you mind 
just unpacking just some of the trends in the first half and outlook in the second half, just among the different 
buckets, like [ph] D1 (00:33:08), Premium Select, domestic first class and Comfort+, payload factors, booking, 
anything else notable you'd call out? Thanks. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
That's a lot. I think what we're very excited about this year is this is the first year that we have ubiquity in Delta 
Premium Select. And that program has exceeded our internal expectations with load factors in the mid to high 80s 
and fare structures that are more than 2x what coach fares are. So, really great margins there, great margins 
continuing in [ph] D1 (00:33:44), domestic first leading the pack in domestic industry. 
 
We're really excited to start rolling out DPS in the transcons this fall with all of our JFK-LA – for those of you who 
follow this industry, the largest revenue market in the country is JFK-LA and having a full suite of products in that 
marketplace we think will be very accretive. And we're out selling it now and September, October advances 
already look very strong there. So, I think continuing that elevation, the margins continue to be really in sequence 
with the best products continuing to have the highest margins and the main cabin coach having the lowest 
margins. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Thomas Fitzgerald 
Analyst, TD Securities (USA) LLC Q 
That's really helpful. Thanks for that color, Glen. And then just quickly, if I may, one for Dan. How should we think 
of – and this is a topic for the whole industry I think, but just how are you and the team thinking about the PSP 
loans resetting to a variable rate, I think it's SOFR plus 2% in 2025 and 2026 and just in the context of the broader 
deleveraging story? Thanks again for the time.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 11-Jul-2024 

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yes. As you know, we continue to focus on deleveraging. We've made a lot of progress since October of 2020. 
$24 billion of debt. So, deleveraging will continue to be at the forefront. 

When you think about those particular tranches, our first one doesn't come due, it's April of second quarter of next 
year and then we have another tranche in first quarter and second quarter of 2026. We'll look at market conditions 
at that point in time, where we are on short-term rates versus long-term rates and whether that would be a long-
term part of the capital structure, it makes more sense to put in other types of debt and refi that out and those will 
be things that we'll probably talk more about in detail as we get closer, especially at Investor Day, but as we get to 
the end of the year and the beginning of next year.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Michael Linenberg 
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q 
Oh, hey. Good morning, everyone. I guess this is a question to Dan and even the team. It's always very helpful 
when you guys call out where your air traffic liability is and how much it's up at least since year end. I sort of think 
we're at a point in the year, where, over the next few weeks, that's going to shift the other way and I think it's 
going to be a bit more pronounced for some of those who maybe have a more seasonal Northern Hemisphere 
type route network. 

When I think about, maybe Glen, you talk about the extension of like Transatlantic and also the strength that 
you're seeing to deep South America and how that's going to improve in the back part of the year combined with 
corporate, how should we think about your swings in your air traffic liability? I mean, in the past, it used to be a 
much bigger hit to cash. And I still think for some carriers, it's going to be a bit of a wake-up call as we get into the 
back half of the year, but I think for you guys, like, how should we think about it and maybe some of the measures 
that you've done to sort of mitigate that? Thanks. And I have a follow-up. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Through the first half, it is up. You can see it is up $2.4 billion. It's up a few hundred million dollars over last year 
and where it sits, it supports our revenue forecast for third quarter. As you get into the back half of the year, 
certainly the elongation of the tattled season helps as it relates to balance that as you go through third quarter 
and into fourth quarter. And also the fact that corporate continues to outgrow consumer, that is also bringing it 
back into what I'd say is more normalized curve as it relates to historical perspective. 

When you look at it year over year, you still got the oddity of last year, you had multiple years of travel credit. So, 
this is the first year that it's much cleaner as we go through and create a better base as you think about it for 2024 
and 2025 and start to evaluate it. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Michael Linenberg 
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q 
Great. And then just my second question, I think Ed or Glen, you talked about capacity cuts being one of the first 
levers that we'll see from other carriers. As we think about where they cut back and maybe certain airports in 
particular, is there an opportunity maybe for you to pick up additional gate space in some of your bigger airports? I

sort of think of some of the cutbacks coming back potentially in Atlanta, Orlando, opportunities where things are 
tight, you'll get additional real estate. Any thoughts on that? Thanks. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Your line is live. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Scott H. Group 
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC Q 
Hey, thanks. Good morning. So, we've talked a lot about just the overall industry capacity outlook, but I want to try 
and get a little bit of Delta color, right? So, your capacity was up 8% in the second quarter, you're saying 5% to 
6% in the third quarter. I guess, any color you can share on your capacity plans entering 2025, just to help get the 
industry supply demand more in balance. Do you anticipate getting to a GDP or sub-GDP type capacity growth, or 
do you think you – as you plan for Delta specifically, do you think you stay above GDP? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
I think we're not going to give capacity growth for 2025 at this point. We've got a lot of runway left in this year. I 
would point out one thing that I think is really important that we ought to just note is that the difference between 
seats and ASMs. And many of you work your models on ASMs. Others work on seats, and I would think when 
you're looking within an entity, it's really the seat count that is most important because we don't sell ASMs, we sell 
seats. And when you think about our capacity growth, although it was 8%, we only grew our seats at about 5% or 
less. So, there's a stage length difference and our stage length is actually a little bit longer than we had in the plan 
because we saw some opportunities on some of the longer haul flying as people restructured through the year. 
 
So, I call it back to let's not talk about ASMs. Let's talk about seats within theater. So, I think that's a much better 
representation of what the industry is facing and one we ought to all key in on as we move toward in trying to 
figure out where the industry is going. So, too early for 2025 in terms of capacity. That will be clearly over the 
back half of the year, we'll reveal more about that. But secondly, try to think about seats as our measure 
domestically is what we're trying to sell. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
And the thing I'd add onto that, Glen, is that 80% of that domestic capacity growth is going into our core hubs and 
to Glen's point, important point on seats, as we get into the back half of this year and fourth quarter is the first time 
we'll have our core hubs restored to levels that they were from a seat perspective versus 2019. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Right. Still versus 2019, we are the least restored in terms of seats.

Yes. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Scott H. Group 
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC Q 
Okay. And then, Dan, I just want to – when I think about the guide, right, if I just take the midpoint of the Q3 guide 
and then the midpoint of the full year guide, it basically implies fourth quarter earnings, just absolute earnings, 
pretty similar with the third quarter, and that's pretty atypical, right? It's usually – we usually see a step down. Any 
color on how to think about that dynamic this year might be different? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah, well, fourth quarter on last year was the only quarter we were down year over year. You also had very high 
fuel in the fourth quarter last year of $3. The current – we'll have to see where that plays out, but the current 
forward of that is much lower, so you get that benefit. And I think it's also with regards to the components that 
Glen's talked about is the inflection in unit revenue as you exit September moving positive and the elongated 
travel season and that strong international demand.

Sheila Kahyaoglu 
Analyst, Jefferies LLC Q 
Good morning, and thank you, guys. Maybe just taking the last two questions and putting it together, your Q4 
guide is a bit wide, and how do you think about the industry capacity issues? Does it get better? Does it get more 
rational? Or does it get worse in 2025 if Boeing gets the delivery cadence back? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Hey, Sheila. Hi. This is Ed. I just want to be clear. We haven't given explicit Q4 guide. So, I appreciate your 
models driving us there. We still have our full year guide with a pretty wide range, as you noted in there. 
 
You may recall last year at this time when things were really starting to look promising, we upped our full year 
guide and we got punished a few months later as the fuel gods worked against us. So, we're confident we'll end 
up in a good point within the full year range but I don't really want to get into trying to figure out what Q4 is.

Well, as I mentioned, we're confident in our Airbus delivery stream. We have no Boeing aircraft coming over the

Duane Pfennigwerth 
Analyst, Evercore ISI Q 
Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just to follow up on corporate travel into September and beyond, can you remind us 
what the headwind was in the fourth quarter of last year from strikes in the auto and entertainment industries? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
So, if you recall, yes, we were heading into the writers' strike right about this time last year and we were in the 
auto in the – really in October timeframe at its peak. So, that was a – I believe we think that's about $100 million in 
terms of a headwind for us or a tailwind this year as we come into the fourth quarter.

Duane Pfennigwerth

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
That was an expensive miss from me, so good for the employee care fund, though. And so, as we look at past the 
Olympics, we see a very robust fall demand for Transatlantic and we're too early to say that it's inflected to 
positive yet because we have – but it could very well inflect to positive. I would be disappointed if it didn't. But 
that's a personal opinion, not a guide, an official guide.

 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Brandon R. Oglenski 
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Q 
Hey, good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. Ed or Glen, if I can come back to Scott's first 
question, thinking about things you can control especially as margins aren't at your target yet, Ed, I know you 
talked a lot about industry capacity coming down into the fourth quarter, but maybe beyond your own capacity and 
the seats discussion, what are other levers you guys are pulling behind the scenes here to help drive 
improvement? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, I think there's quite a bit. Clearly, as the demand set that we see in our specific customer base continues to 
look healthy, we're going to continue investing there. We've got a pretty robust set of new offerings coming in in 
the premium space, and Wi-Fi is going to be free and fast and fully available, and largely fully available in the 
Transatlantic by the end of this summer, which is a big deal for us. 

On the cost side, we had really good cost performance in the first half of the year. I anticipate that we're going to 
continue to hold that. I realize the third quarter guide is a touch larger than what we saw in Q2 but we're going to 
work hard to get that back down. I think we've all talked about the opportunities this year on the cost front to 
continue to grow into our larger head count. We're not there yet. We still have more growth opportunities to get 
there. 

So, I think across the board, Brandon, we have opportunities and we are certainly not sitting back waiting for the 
industry to fix itself. If that was the case, we wouldn't be delivering the outstanding level of profitability that we are 
and – but we hope that that's going to be another tailwind for Delta. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Brandon R. Oglenski 
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Q 
I appreciate that response. And maybe, Dan, as a follow-up, can you talk about head count trends into next year 
and if you're seeing efficiencies as you restore your core hubs?

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yes, we are. And just this year alone, we will have head count that will grow – our resources will grow just under 
2% while we're growing the network in mid-single digits and I think – and that's been the case even versus the 
trailing 12 months, we're up only 3% on our resources versus the growth that we've demonstrated and I think that 
– and delivered. So, I think that is kind of the leading edge of us, the step here, first few steps here of us growing 
back into those resources and those capabilities. And it's just not people, right? It's the aircraft and the utilization 
of the aircraft. It's growing into the airports and the investment that we made. Glen always reminds me the most 
expensive day is the first day that you open it, so it's across the board. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
And one other thing, Brandon. This is Ed again. Don't lose sight of the free cash we're throwing off. This year, 
we'll throw off between $3 billion and $4 billion. I'm confident in that guide, which we gave at the start of the year. I 
expect at least as good next year again, compounded effect of all that cash and we'll continue to delever the 
balance sheet is once again going to differentiate Delta within this industry.

 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Ravi Shanker 
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q 
Thanks. Morning, everyone. I just want to follow up – a couple of follow-ups here. One is on the international 
commentary. You guys said a couple of times international is looking pretty strong through the fall. Is that just 
spillover, like from the air pocket for the Olympics kind of spreading to other periods? Are you seeing an 
acceleration there in any particular geographies? If you can just unpack that, that would be great. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
I think generally we see the season extending as a whole group of people, whether or not it's retirees, whether or 
not it's people with double incomes and without children who don't have the school concerns, it's actually a better 
time to go to Europe in September and October than it is potentially in July and August when the weather is so 
hot and everything is so packed. So, we are really seeing an extension into September and October and really 
into through November that European demand across the board is remaining strong. So, that's very exciting for 
us. 
 
The same thing is happening in the leisure markets in the Pacific. Interestingly enough, Japan has turned into a 
US point-of-sale leisure market with the yen hitting at ¥160, so we have really record numbers of US tourists

heading to Japan, which is such a great destination. And that, again, that has a very strong fall season. So, really 
looking at US origin, high-end leisure extending the season through October and into November.

Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q 
Understood. That's great color. And maybe a follow-up on the previous discussion on the premiumization of the 
industry, kind of as the lower cost carriers push towards premium, I just wanted to kind of clarify your comments. 
Are you saying that there's more opportunity for you guys to kind of push up kind of as the bottom comes up and 
but kind of do you have a sense of how high it can go? Or I mean [ph] there was also (00:50:55) some concern as 
others premiumize, there's going to be more competition for a fixed set of premium demands. How do you see 
that playing out? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
I think it's both. We have and we continue to have opportunities to grow premium. Premium's growing double-digit 
for us and we don't see that slowing down. So, Delta, on its own right, continues to grow there. And what will 
happen is as others, if they do choose to continue to upgrade their products, it's going to force them to also 
upgrade their price points, which will help our main cabin revenues as well. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
That was the point I think we should continue to reinforce is when you take away revenue streams, you have to 
replace them with other revenue streams, and so as the ULCCs look to make their product more value, they have 
to increase their base fares just to remain constant in terms of revenue. And I think that is a – maybe a missed 
point here is that's actually good for the industry.

Julie Stewart

We'll now go to our final analyst Q&A. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  
 

Operator: Certainly. Your next question is coming from Andrew Didora from Bank of America. Your line is live. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Andrew G. Didora 
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc. Q 
Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Maybe, Dan, helpful commentary on the 2% 
fleet growth this year, and I know you aren't prepared to give the 2025 capacity growth now, but can you maybe 
help us think about the 2025 fleet or seat growth based on kind of where you see deliveries and expected 
retirements over the next 18 months?

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 11-Jul-2024 
 
Yeah, I think you – as we're taking about 40 deliveries this year, as I mentioned, give or take one or two and how 
it falls out, on average when you look forward into next year, it's around 50. We're right in that 40 to 50 range 
associated with that and you're going to continue to see a steady drumbeat of retirements probably in the mid-20s 
as we go through 2025. We'll finalize that as we get through our final plan and tweak that in regards to what it is 
but it's older fleets, right, the [ph] 75s (00:52:59), starting to see some of the [ph] 76s (00:53:02) and the 320s. 
 
And as we've all talked about, those – as we've been trying to grow, we haven't been able to retire it, what we're 
used to. This is the first time we're actually meaningfully retiring aircraft over the last two to three years and that 
then benefits us, right, because that then is a material stream back into our TechOps operation, maintenance 
operations that can use that material and take improved efficiency which they've been so good at through the 
years when you look at the last decade. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Andrew G. Didora 
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc. Q 
Got it. That's actually very helpful. And just as my follow-up, Ed, I know you mentioned on the last call that you felt 
like you still have more debt than you're comfortable with. Is there any framework you can outline in terms of just 
give us a sense of how you think about the proper level of debt that gets you to a much more comfortable place? 
Thank you. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Andrew, I think that's a perfect question for November. We'll answer that at that time. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Andrew G. Didora 
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc. Q 
Great. Thank you. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Julie Stewart 
Vice President-Investor Relations, Delta Air Lines A 
That will wrap up the analyst portion of the call. I'll now turn it over to Tim Mapes to start the media questions. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Tim Mapes 
Senior Vice President & Chief Communications Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Thank you, Julie. Matthew, if you don't mind, as we transition from the analysts to the members of the media, if 
you could please repeat just the instructions for getting into the call queue, please? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  
 

Operator: Certainly. At this time, we'll be conducting a Q&A session for media questions. [Operator Instructions] 
Thank you. Your first question is coming from Leslie Joseph (sic) [Leslie Josephs] (00:54:46) from CNBC. Your 
line is live. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Leslie Josephs 
Reporter, CNBC LLC Q 
Hi. Good morning, everybody. Just a couple of questions. For Premium Economy, are you seeing most travelers 
buy that at the onset of – or the outset of their booking, or are they doing buy-ups after? And is that still the most 
profitable part of the cabin? And then on Wi-Fi, when do you expect the entire main line fleet to have the fast and 
free Wi-Fi for SkyMiles members? Thanks.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 11-Jul-2024 
 
Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Do you want to take that, [ph] Ed (00:55:14)? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
You take the first one, [ph] I'll take second (00:55:13). 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
So, the question was on Delta Premium Select? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Leslie Josephs 
Reporter, CNBC LLC Q 
Yes. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Premium Economy, we're just Premium Select? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Leslie Josephs 
Reporter, CNBC LLC Q 
Yeah. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
So, that is mostly being bought like all of our products at initial purchase. And as you know, we design that to be 
flexible so people could do it post-purchase and they could do it with multiple forms of payment including miles as 
they upgrade for people whose companies might not allow them to buy those that they could use their miles to 
upgrade into those. But still over 80% come at initial booking. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
And on the... 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Leslie Josephs 
Reporter, CNBC LLC Q 
And is it still the most profitable cabin? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Delta Premium Select, I think, in terms of profitability, it is the third most profitable, right? Our Delta One is the 
most profitable. It really goes down domestic first and then Delta Premium Select. So, really in terms of the 
hierarchy, the more premium the product, the higher the margin.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 11-Jul-2024 
 
Leslie Josephs 
Reporter, CNBC LLC Q 
Okay. Delta One, first class domestic, and then Delta Premium Select, on all routes. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
And, Leslie, on the Wi-Fi question, we are continuing to roll it out, making good progress. The focus right at the 
moment is getting our international fleet equipped. We'll have largely the Transatlantic pretty well fully up and 
running by the end of the summer, over the next couple of months. And our remaining focus after that is getting 
the regionals as well as our any remaining domestic aircraft, which is principally the 717 fleet up and running over 
the next 12 to 18 months. So, we're getting there. Certainly on a passenger count level, we're well over 50% at 
the present time. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Leslie Josephs 
Reporter, CNBC LLC Q 
Perfect. Thank you. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  
 

Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question is coming from Mary Schlangenstein from 
Bloomberg News. Your line is live. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Mary Schlangenstein 
Reporter, Bloomberg News Q 
Hi. Thank you. I wanted to see if you could just give us a little more detail on the Japan situation that you 
mentioned. Is that just primarily leisure, or what is your business travel looking like between the US and Japan as 
well? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
US and Japan business is quite strong. It has been since the end of the pandemic. And what we've seen is really 
a new Japan as a destination market. I think when the yen was ¥83, it was very difficult to be able to afford to go 
see Japan and all the great things that Japan has to offer. With the yen at ¥160, it's a very different world for US 
travelers and they seem to be taking great advantage of that. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Mary Schlangenstein 
Reporter, Bloomberg News Q 
And what about on the business side? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Business continues to remain strong. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Mary Schlangenstein 
Reporter, Bloomberg News Q 
Okay. And the other question I had was you all haven't talked for some time about the refinery and whether you're 
still in any sort of discussions to develop a partnership or sell the refinery. Can you give us an update on that?
