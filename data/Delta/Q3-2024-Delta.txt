MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION 
 
 
Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Delta Air Lines September Quarter 2024 Financial 
Results Conference Call. My name is Matthew, and I'll be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are in a 
listen-only mode, until we conduct a question-and-answer session, following the presentation. As a reminder, 
today's call being recorded. [Operator Instructions] 
 
I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go 
ahead. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Julie Stewart 
Vice President-Investor Relations & Corporate Development, Delta Air Lines, Inc. 

Thank you, Matthew, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our September Quarter 2024 
Earnings Call. 
 
Joining us from Atlanta today, are our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; and our CFO, Dan 
Janki. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta's performance and strategy, Glen will provide an update on 
the revenue environment, and Dan will discuss costs and our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we'll 
take analyst questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow up, so that we can 
get to as many of you as possible. After the analyst Q&A, we will move to media questions. 
 
Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future 
events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ 
materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are 
described in Delta's SEC filings. 
 
We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. 
You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com. Please 
note that page 2 of the earnings release today outlines the impact of the CrowdStrike-caused outage on our Q3 
profitability and unit metrics consistent with our initial disclosure on August 8. 
 
Now I'll turn the call over to Ed. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. 

Thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. 
 
Before we begin, I want to provide a quick update on Hurricane Milton. The safety of our people, customers, and 
communities is always paramount, and to that end, we've issued a fee waiver and implemented fare caps to those 
who need to change their travel plans or fly out of the storm's path. We've also added additional flights and 
upgauged aircraft into Florida this week to accommodate those evacuating the state. Between yesterday and 
today, we have canceled approximately 600 flights in total, but we'll have a better sense of the impact as we learn 
of how our airports fared overnight. Our hearts are with all those in the Southeast, who have been affected during 
this storm season.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 10-Oct-2024 
 
Now turning to our earnings report. Earlier this morning, we reported our September quarter results consistent 
with our latest guidance. On an earnings per share basis, our results would have been at the high end of initial 
guidance excluding the $0.45 impact from the CrowdStrike-caused outage. Delta continues to lead the industry 
operationally and financially, while delivering on our 2024 plan. Year-to-date, our on-time performance is best in 
the industry, and our completion factor leads the network carriers even when including the impact of the outage. 
 
Financially, we have delivered double-digit operating margins with nearly $3 billion of free cash flow year-to-date. 
And following the Fitch upgrade in July, our balance sheet now has two investment-grade ratings, and our 
dividend yield is in line with the S&P 500. Delta's year-to-date profitability is expected to represent 50% of the 
industry's total profits for the double-digit return on invested capital that is more than twice the industry average, 
reflecting the durability of our business model. 
 
I'm incredibly proud of the Delta people for delivering these results. I want to thank them for their outstanding work 
during this busy summer period and their dedication to providing best-in-class service for our customers. Sharing 
our financial success with our people is a long-standing pillar of our culture. With this quarter's financial 
performance, we've accrued nearly $1 billion year-to-date towards next February's profit sharing. We expect this 
will be among our top profit sharing payments in Delta's history and more than the rest of the industry combined. 
 
The combination of our industry-leading reliability and best-in-class service from our people has firmly established 
Delta as the premium airline of choice, empowers our brand momentum. The new Delta One Lounge in JFK has 
been an incredible success with very high customer satisfaction. Building on this momentum, this morning we 
opened our new Delta One Lounge at LAX, and we will be opening our third Delta One Lounge in Boston this 
December, and the fourth in Seattle early next year. 
 
By year end, Delta will have over 700,000 square feet across 55 Sky Clubs and 3 Delta One Lounges, a one-of-a-
kind position across many of the largest airports in the country. Onboard, we are enhancing the customer 
experience with a rollout of our popular Delta Sync product to more than 330 aircraft, offering SkyMiles members, 
a personalized experience that provides a smart TV on the seatback screen. More than 90% of our domestic 
mainline network now offers fast, free Wi-Fi, and this summer, we began introducing fast, free – excuse me, fast, 
free in-flight Wi-Fi on long-haul international flights. 
 
Across the network, Delta's advantages continue to build. Core hubs are nearing full restoration as we close out 
the year, and we are harvesting the investments we've made in coastal gateways to improve margins and support 
profitable international growth. Around the world, we're continuing to develop our JV partnerships and leveraging 
our strengths. Our recently announced summer 2025 Transatlantic schedule will build on our strong performance 
in our largest and most profitable international region. 
 
As brand preference continues to grow, we are driving deeper levels of engagement and our SkyMiles 
membership is attracting a younger consumer. We have seen a significant evolution in our active member base 
post-COVID with 3 million more active members under 40 years of age, more than doubling member engagement 
with non-air partnerships, allowing us to earn a higher share of wallet. Deeper engagement with Delta drives 
higher customer satisfaction, reinforces loyalty, and creates greater lifetime customer value. 
 
Turning to our outlook, consumers are continuing to prioritize premium experiences, and our core customer base 
is in a healthy financial position, with travel remaining a top spend category. Corporate travel continues to 
improve, and Delta is well positioned as the business carrier of choice. And importantly, domestic supply growth 
continues to rationalize. Across much of the industry, there has been an accelerated pace of change, and we are 
encouraged by the actions the industry is taking to improve profitability and returns.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 10-Oct-2024 
 
 
In the December quarter, the improved revenue trends we saw in the month of September are continuing, and we 
expect to grow earnings 30% over last year with pre-tax income of $1.4 billion, which would mark one of the best 
if not the best fourth quarters in our history. With this, our full year outlook for earnings is expected to be around 
the midpoint of our initial $6 to $7 EPS guidance from the start of the year, excluding the $0.45 impact from the 
CrowdStrike-caused outage. 
 
As we approach the end of our three-year plan that we laid out in late 2021, we have delivered consistent 
financial performance, restoring our financial foundation while navigating ever-changing macro and industry 
environments from a position of strength. Our performance is a testament to the durability we are creating at 
Delta, built on years of investing in our people and our product while continuing to restore our balance sheet 
strength. 
 
Delta has built unmatched competitive advantages and structurally improved our business for the long term. Next 
month, at our Investor Day, we will introduce an updated long-term financial framework that builds on our 
durability and reflects the opportunities that we see ahead to create sustainable long-term value for our owners. 
As we approach our 100-year anniversary next year, I've never been more excited about Delta's position and the 
opportunity that lies ahead. 
 
Thank you again. And with that, let me hand it over to Glen for more details on our commercial performance. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. 

Thank you, Ed, and good morning. I want to start by thanking all of our employees for their hard work during this 
busy summer travel season. They are the Delta difference. 
 
Delta delivered September quarter revenue consistent with our latest guidance, despite the impact from Hurricane 
Helene. During the quarter, unit revenue improved sequentially in all geographic entities, reflecting the strength in 
travel demand and an improving industry backdrop. In the month of September, unit revenue inflected to positive 
in both Domestic and Transatlantic. 
 
Domestic industry seat growth moderated significantly from the peak in June, with the industry now growing seats 
in line with demand. Transatlantic benefited from ongoing strength in US point of sale and a rebound in Paris 
demand as soon as the Olympics ended. Corporate travel sales were up 7% during the quarter, led by double-
digit growth in coastal hubs with broad-based strength across sectors. 
 
Delta is the clear industry leader and offering premium experiences and more choices for our customers with 
significant investment across the travel experience over the last 15 years. Our new Delta One lounges in New 
York and LA with dedicated check-in and private TSA security truly differentiate Delta's premium offering in the 
two largest revenue markets in the United States. We also introduced Delta Premium Select on transcon flights 
between JFK and LA, and we'll expand this offering to all daily frequencies next month. 
 
Similar to our international rollout, the initial customer reception to Delta Premium Select has far exceeded our 
expectations. Consistently delivering elevated experience that customers value is driving outperformance in 
premium products across geographies. During the quarter, premium revenue growth outperformed the main cabin 
by 9 points. At the same time, Delta is growing SkyMiles membership and deepening our customer engagement.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 10-Oct-2024 
 
The success of our strategy is best illustrated by our unit revenue premium relative to the industry, the growing 
loyalty of our brand and our increasingly diversified revenue base. Year-to-date, 57% of our revenue has been 
generated outside of selling main cabin seats, underpinning Delta's financial leadership and supporting durable 
performance that significantly outpaces the industry. 
 
Loyalty revenue was up 6% versus last year, with growth in our SkyMiles membership and strength in our 
American Express co-brand portfolio. American Express remuneration for the quarter was $1.8 billion, up 6% 
year-over-year, delivering solid performance in a backdrop of moderating inflation. Cargo revenue was 27% 
higher than last year with double-digit growth across all international regions. I am encouraged by the results and 
the opportunity to better leverage our increasingly cargo-capable fleet. 
 
Looking forward, demand for travel on Delta remains healthy with continued preference for our premium offerings. 
Our recent corporate survey indicates a positive outlook for business demand with 85% of respondents indicating 
they expect their travel spend to grow in 2025. For the December quarter, we expect total revenue to increase 2% 
to 4% over prior year on a 3% to 4% higher capacity level. The improved unit revenue trends we saw in the month 
of September are continuing into the December quarter with healthy bookings for the holidays. 
 
As we've seen historically, domestic travel demand is impacted in the weeks surrounding the election, resulting in 
an expected 1-point impact to system unit revenue for the quarter. With favorable industry capacity dynamics and 
a strong demand set, we are well positioned as we close out the year and head into 2025. Our industry leadership 
and differentiation has never been greater, creating the foundation for us to unlock the value of our trusted 
customer brand and further diversify our revenue base. 
 
In closing, I'm excited about our opportunities ahead, and I look forward to sharing more with you at our Investor 
Day next month. And with that, let me turn it over to Dan. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. 

Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. Operationally, our teams delivered through a busy summer 
travel season. Year-to-date, Delta has achieved 60 days of zero cancellations, nearly twice all of last year. Today, 
we reported another quarter of strong financial performance with $1.3 billion of pre-tax income for the September 
quarter. 
 
On non-fuel unit costs, performance was in line with our expectation. Unit costs grew 5.7%, including a 3.2-point 
impact from the CrowdStrike-caused outage and a 0.5-point impact from the decision to reward employees with 
travel passes for their hard work through the summer. Now, fuel prices declined 9% over prior year, averaging 
$2.53 per gallon for the quarter, including a $0.03 loss from the refinery. Fuel efficiency improved approximately 
1% year-over-year. 
 
During the quarter, we took delivery of nine next-gen Airbus aircraft and retired six aircraft. We continue to expect 
our fleet growth to be less than 2% this year with 20 net aircraft additions, as half of our new deliveries are 
replacements. 
 
Operating cash flow year-to-date was $6.2 billion. After reinvesting $3.6 billion back into the business, we 
generated free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Strong cash generation has supported debt repayment of $2.4 billion 
year-to-date, including $900 million of early repayments. Gross leverage ended the quarter at 2.9 times.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 10-Oct-2024 
 
For the year, we expect to repay nearly $4 billion of debt, bringing our cumulative debt paydown to more than $12 
billion over the last three years. As we retire secured debt and pay cash for our aircraft, our unencumbered asset 
base is expected to grow to $30 billion by year end. Our financial foundation continues to strengthen. We 
achieved a meaningful milestone during the quarter with our balance sheet receiving an upgrade to investment-
grade from Fitch. Delta is now investment-grade rated at Moody's and Fitch, and one notch away at S&P with a 
positive outlook. 
 
Now moving to guidance. For the December quarter, we expect to deliver 2 points of margin – operating margin 
expansion and earnings growth of 30% compared to the prior year. Fuel prices are expected to be $2.20 to $2.40 
per gallon, more than 20% lower year-over-year, including a few cent impact from a modest loss at the refinery. 
Unit costs are expected to be up 3% from last year as capacity growth moderates to the 3% to 4%, keeping our 
full year outlook for non-fuel costs in line with our initial guidance of up low-single-digit. 
 
With hiring and training normalizing, we are growing into our resources and gaining traction on efficiency and 
initiatives, helping fund continued investments in our people and brand. December quarter earnings are expected 
to be $1.60 to $1.85 per share on 11% to 13% operating margins. We are focused on finishing the year strong, 
delivering industry-leading performance with a return to earnings growth and margin expansion positioning us well 
as we head into 2025. 
 
Delta's differentiation has never been greater. Our brand and financial performance are transcending the industry, 
and we're generating a return on invested capital that is 5 points ahead of our cost of capital and better than half 
of the S&P 500. Looking forward, we remain focused on delivering durable earnings in cash generation that 
enable us to further strengthen our balance sheet and create long-term value for our shareholders. 
 
I look forward to sharing more details with you at our Investor Day next month. In closing, our performance is a 
result of the hard work of our employees. I want to thank the Delta people for continuing to go above and beyond 
for our customers and each other every day. 
 
Now with that, I'll turn it back to Julie for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION 
 
 
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from David Vernon from Bernstein. 
Your line is live. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

David Vernon 
Analyst, Bernstein Institutional Services LLC Q 
So Glen, first question for you on the election. Can you just help us get comfortable with how you're separating 
out that impact with what you're seeing internally and maybe talk to what gives you confidence that this isn't just a 
weakness in the consumer that's showing up in some of the forward revenue data? Thanks. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Absolutely. I think it's a – if you were looking at our internal numbers, it's really obvious to see the trend lines, 
where you have markets that are performing incredibly well with positive momentum in October. And then again 
as soon as the week after the election is complete and on into December and really all the way into January. So if 
you took a trend line, you'd see these two weeks just being way off trend. And I think, it's a – we said in the 
comments that it's domestic, but it's also short-haul Latin. It's pretty much across the board that those two weeks 
are underperforming the trends before and after those weeks. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

David Vernon 
Analyst, Bernstein Institutional Services LLC Q 
Okay. And then maybe I just – Ed, can you talk at a high level about how Delta is thinking about domestic 
capacity kind of going forward? Lower cost airlines cutting capacity. Does that make you think about share any 
differently here? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, David, that's a great prelude into next month's Investor Day, where we'll be giving you our perspective on 
that. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

David Vernon 
Analyst, Bernstein Institutional Services LLC Q 
We try to help. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
We did, as you know, file our summer schedule last week, and Atlanta is one of the markets where we are finally 
at a position to be at, if not better than pre-COVID levels in capacity. So very excited about that. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 10-Oct-2024 
 
Jamie N. Baker 
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q 
Oh, thanks. And good morning, everybody. Couple for Glen. So Glen, when I think about the phenomenon of 
tightening domestic capacity, my assumption has always been that the first routes that are called provide the 
greatest uplift to RASM. From there, RASM benefits still accrue over time but at – sort of a declining rate of 
improvement. Is that the right way to be thinking about it that the benefits are front end loaded? Or is the reality 
something different? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, Jamie, I'm trying to understand whose perspective you're looking at that from. Are you looking at it from the 
perspective of the people who are cutting the capacity or the people who are the beneficiary of those capacity 
cuts? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Jamie N. Baker 
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q 
The latter, the beneficiary. So Delta, in this case. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
I would say, if you think about how – if just normal course of business, and this is just hypothetical that if you're 
cutting capacity, you're cutting your worst routes first. So the upside accrual from that to the remaining capacity is 
actually the least. And as you move through and go up to better and better capacity cuts that more and more 
accrues to the remaining capacity. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Jamie N. Baker 
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q 
Okay. All right. That's very helpful. And then second, on corporate demand, I'm curious what sort of recovery 
you're thinking about for 2025. But more importantly, does it influence how you think about the network? I mean, 
hypothetically, you know, I'm not arguing that this would happen, but if we saw a full restoration to where 
corporate trends would be, had COVID not occurred, would you need to rebalance the network much? Or would it 
simply be an exercise of potentially allocating less capacity to lower fare buckets? Thanks in advance. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah. I would suggest it's the latter. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Jamie N. Baker 
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q 
Okay. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
As we pointed out that premium products are really doing much better currently than coach. And as we move 
through the next couple of schedule changes and adjustments heading into the tail end of the year, we expect 
that momentum to pick up as the carriers that have primarily coach products begin rationalizing capacity. So I

think we always have room for our business customers onboard our network. And clearly, if certain companies 
pick up business or start new factories, we're always talking to our clients to see where they might need additional 
capacity. But generally, I think we're in a very good spot. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q 
Got it. Thank you very much.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is live. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Savanthi Syth 
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Q 
Hey. Good morning, everyone. Glen, I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color on how you're 
thinking about kind of the unit revenue projection in, in the fourth quarter by entity is, and the – just kind of the 
trends beyond the election? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah. I got a – something is wrong with your phone there. But so you're asking about trends after the election by 
entity? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Or unit revenue? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Savanthi Syth 
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Q 
Kind of what your expectations are? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Right. I think we certainly said that Domestic and Transatlantic are leading the way, and I think that will continue 
as we head into the back half of the year. Actually, I'm most excited about this winter in the Transatlantic, where 
we have done some capacity adjustments and underperforming capacity last year, and we see really encouraging 
signs of where we have allocated that capacity along with robust demand in the off season. So really looking 
forward to the Transatlantic results. 
 
Pacific, we had some more – some additional capacity, and as we head out of this year, I think, it's – Japan looks 
strong. The south Pacific looks strong. China is looking stronger as we lapse the big increase or lapsed the big 
increase in capacity last year. And we're seeing a little weakness in South Korea but nothing major. So we'll keep 
an eye on that. And then Latin is continuing its improvement as we move through the quarter, and hopefully, we 
can inflect that into positive as we move into January and beyond. So I think we're sitting in a pretty good spot 
with all entities as we head out of this year and into 2025 and very encouraged by the trends, when you look 
beyond the election.

Very helpful. Thank you. And if I might, just on the follow up on the Hurricane Helene, you called out impact of 
$0.03. I know, it's really early days. I'm just kind of curious, if you have kind of an impact of Hurricane Milton in

seeing demand up 7%, 8% in the summer. And I think you had indicated that actually a lot of it was promotional – 
driven by promotions, and that organic demand was maybe closer to about 4% domestically. When I heard you 
talk about in the comments, in your script talked about domestic, where it seems like supply and demand are now 
in sync, and if I look at where domestic supply is right now, it is about 1.5%, 2%, are you sort of indicating that 
maybe domestic demand organically is around 2%? Are we running a little bit better than that? Can you give 
some additional color on that? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah. I think, we haven't gotten there yet. So it's really impossible for me to say. But I think we are still in that kind 
of 4%-ish. So we'll see. If capacity is up 1.5% or 2% as we get through these next few months and we see 
continued positive momentum in yield, that will tell. And I think that's what we're encouraged about, and that's 
what we're excited about as we head to the end of this year, as we think this balance has not been this good in 
quite some time. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Michael Linenberg 
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Q 
Great. And then, just my second question. I think, on the distribution front, it does look like, I believe, correct me if 
I'm wrong, you may have recently sort of renewed your agreements with all of the GDSs, and I know that you've 
been moving more into sort of the – on the NDC side with respect to distribution. How should we think about your 
cost of distribution? Is that going to be maybe a potential tailwind as we head into 2025? Thanks for taking my 
question.

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
I think our strategy is really, one, we want to meet customers where they want to be. And if they want to use 
OTAs, if they want to use GDS, we want to have the best suite of products in each one of those. And over time, I 
think you've seen a decrease in distribution costs, and will that continue? I don't know. That's what consumers 
want to do. And I think our job is to make sure that we have best-in-class products on the shelves at all of our 
distributors.

live. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Conor Cunningham 
Analyst, Melius Research LLC Q 
Hi, everyone. Thank you. Really outside of you guys and United, the industry continues to try to reinvent itself 
through product and network changes. When you think about the opportunity that presents to you, just how 
aggressive do you, like, pretend that – like, thinking – or thinking about being just given the turmoil and others? 
Like, you're already deepening your moat, like, in real time, and I'm just trying to understand how deep it is or how 
deep you can get it from here. Thanks. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
First, I think we'll have much more to talk about that at Investor Day because that really goes to the strategy in the 
next three years. But I think our strategy is consistent to develop free cash flow, pay down our debt, and not to be 
a great moat in the long term. So maybe I'll turn it over to Dan to talk about that. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
I think, as you – Conor, as you – we want to build off of our success that we had. And if you look at it even over 
the last decade, but even over the last 18 months, that durability of earnings to be double digit when the industry's 
been down and to deliver double-digit margins over that period of time, I think, continue to speak to the durability 
of the franchise and ability to create the profitability but generate the cash. 
 
And Glen picked up on a word there which is consistency. You're just going to consistently see us do it, whether 
it's how we execute commercially, where we put our aircraft, the amount of aircraft that we're taking, the 
investment back in the business. We're just – that consistency of executing the strategy has always been core to 
Delta and will continue to be core. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Conor Cunningham

industry is announcing, you talked a little bit about Delta Sync, but what else is there to kind of – to widen that gap 
to the new products that are already out there – or that are being announced, I should say? Thank you.

for you to take a look at it.

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah. Hey, Conor, this is Ed. And Glen is right, we'll be spending a lot of time talking about that next month. But 
this is a platform we've been on for 15 years, right? So, I understand how others are now looking to adapt. It's 
really hard to change course and to try to catch what is a train that's moving at a pretty good speed. I should say a 
plane, really, moving at a pretty good speed here, whether it's the investment in the lounges that you're seeing 
and the Delta One experience, the free Wi-Fi. And I know everybody wants to do free Wi-Fi now. We've been on 
this for years. And so, we'll continue on the pace we're on. We're not going to change course. If anything, we're 
just going to continue to accelerate.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is 
live. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Duane Pfennigwerth 
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC Q 
Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Just on seasonality, obviously, there's a lot of – or a bit of noise right now in the 
baseline with hurricane impacts and with holiday shifts here in October. But as we look at volume growth for the 
industry, it looks like trends are following much more 2019 baseline than they are really last year. And so, I 
wanted to ask you, do you see seasonality changing on the leisure side or on the corporate travel side? And was 
there anything about this time last year that was an anomaly? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, you mentioned one, it was the shift of the Jewish holidays into October versus September. Of course, the 
hurricanes. But I think if you take a broader longer-term vision, we have seen really August, in particular, but to a 
slightly lesser extent, July become less peaky, particularly in long-haul international, and that September and

October are becoming prime travel months. And I think that's something that will continue, as schools continue to 
go back earlier in a lot of the country. And the weather in Europe in August is really hot, and that people who have 
choices when they can take their vacations are moving into, let's call it, more temperate months. Corporate, we 
haven't seen much change year-over-year, but I think it's continuing to shift travel to Europe, in particular, from 
July and August peak to a September and October peak. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Duane Pfennigwerth 
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC Q 
That's helpful. And then just – thanks, Glen. Just for my follow-up, as you think about more modest fleet growth, 
less training investment, less maintenance investment, maybe there should be a question mark at the end of that 
one, going forward, what inning are we in for productivity recovery at Delta and what metric should we be 
watching on that front? Thank you. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
We are – thanks, Duane. Yes, we're still in the early innings of where we and we're pleased with the progress if 
you look at how we ended last year and the last six months, and you look at this year up low-single digits. We 
expect to be up 2% (sic) [3%] for the year on non-fuel cost. You're starting to see that. 
 
I think one of the proxies that we've always talked about is that we put the workforce in ahead of the operation 
and growth and that you'd see efficiency come off of that. So if I point you to something, look at third quarter 
workforce year-over-year. It's up 1.5%. And the network's up over 5%, right. So you're starting to grow into those 
resources and drive that efficiency across your work groups. 
 
But as I've talked about, different parts of our operation are different journey. And we're just starting. As you know, 
this year we've made an incremental investment in maintenance that we talked about on the 350. That's having 
the impact that we wanted. Maintenance cancels are down 75% year-to-date – year-over-year. And so – but that 
part of the productivity will start as we get into next year and the year beyond and the year beyond, as we make 
progress against that. Same with our crews. 
 
And so you're seeing it in operations that have already started. Airport operations, our customer care operations, 
making good progress on efficiency, and more will kick in as we go through next year. And we'll get the benefit of 
the full year of having our core hubs restored, which are a low cost. That will be the full impact next year, and 
we're going to continue to get utilization out of the fleet and better utilization out of the regional aircraft, will be by 
next summer 100% restored on those, and continue to get better wide body utilization as we get this extended 
flying season and counter-seasonal flying. So all those are – the things that you saw started today are things 
you're going to hear us talk about at Investor Day and you're going to hear through 2025 and 2026 just be 
components that we can build on. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
And Duane, technology also plays a big role in that continued productivity opportunity. And as we now have our 
team fully up to speed and the development, the experience that where we want it to be, we'll be able to leverage 
those tools a little better going forward.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Your line is live. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Scott H. Group 
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC Q 
Hey. Thanks. Good morning. So I know, Glen, you don't typically talk much about like monthly trends, but just 
directionally, just so we understand, can you maybe give some color, like is October, in your view of December, 
right, if we eliminate the November and the elections? Are October and December positive on unit revenue? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah. We're not going to give that level of detail, but I would say that October and December are significantly 
better than November. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Scott H. Group 
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC Q 
Okay. Fair enough. And then, Dan, can you just maybe talk about some of the puts and takes to be thinking about 
for CASM next year? I know we'll probably get more of a guide at Analyst Day, but directionally just puts and 
takes to be thinking about? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah. I'd say, building off of – thanks, Scott. Building off the previous question, and we will share more at the 
Investor Day, but the context is again consistency, right. Things that you saw this year, we're going to continue to 
invest back into our workforce, continue to invest back into our brand, and you're going to see those consistently. 
But at the same time, you're going to have benefits of efficiency growing into that workforce. You've got the 
elements that I talked about with maintenance. We know we put the incremental investment in, we'll start to get 
those elements back, the crew, the other components associated with that. And then, as Ed mentioned, longer 
term technology. You start to get it next year, but that will come for years to come. The industry is built for it, and 
we're built for it.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 10-Oct-2024 
 
Hey. Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. So Ed or Glen, you guys did volunteer it, so maybe I'll try 
to pry a little bit of a preview of Investor Day out of here. But you did talk about Atlanta being up in the summer 
schedule next year. I think you even have a news article out saying, flights could be up high-single-digit levels. 
Can you maybe specifically speak to that aspect of the strategy as you look forward without maybe giving too 
much away? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, sure. We have really wanted, as we said earlier, in the coming out of COVID to solidify our positions in the 
coastal cities. And I think as you look at where we are today, clearly the leader in Boston, we asserted ourselves 
as the leader in New York, made an incremental improvements in Seattle and widened our lead in Los Angeles. 
So I put a check mark on those, at the – to the detriment of the core hubs, because we just didn't have enough 
assets to do it all at once. 
 
So we're really focused and we'll talk much more about this next week. Next year is really about some 
incremental adds, of course, that are key to continuing our journey in the coastal gateways, but a vast majority of 
that going back into our core hubs as the regional jets come back to full utilization as we can push utilization up. 
And I think if you take a long-term view of Atlanta over the – not just last year or the year before, but where we've 
come, it's really about driving efficiency through our core hub, which represents about 30% to 35% of our total unit 
revenues that flow through here. 
 
And really driving efficiency through that with larger gauge, with actually fewer frequencies still than we had in 
2019, but seats that will be above that level. So another push through gauge through Atlanta as well as then 
taking those smaller airplanes and feed – building our feed network back in Detroit or Minneapolis. So we're really 
excited about where we're going to go next year. We're going to have much more details about that all next 
month, but we're pumped about where we're headed for 2025. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Brandon R. Oglenski 
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc. Q 
Really appreciate that, Glen. And then Dan, maybe just as a quick follow up on that, I mean, does this have 
broader implications for your airport costs? Because those seem to be part of the inflationary pressures and the 
industry at whole. Going back to your core hubs, does that have a positive impact looking ahead? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah. When you look at that airport line, you see it in the SEC filings, right. For the quarter and year-to-date, it's 
up over 20%, and one-third of that is these investments we made that we're making in these generational assets. 
And as Glen always reminds me, they're always the most expensive on day one, and you grow into them over 
time. So the opportunity in front of us is to grow in and get better utilization out of those assets that we've invested 
in over this period of time. And you see it throughout the network. It's all the places that Glen talked about in 
regards to the New York markets with both LaGuardia, JFK, LA, Salt Lake City, but also the investment we 
consistently make year in and year out through Atlanta and continue to make that the flagship of Delta. So that 
will give us continued leverage.

The thing I would add, Brandon, is that the bulk of those investments are behind us. And as we see what's going 
on in the industry, we know there's other airports, not necessarily Delta core hubs that still have work to go. So 
this is something that we're going to be able to leverage over next few years, having made the investment and 
starting to drive better efficiency, and I think it will be a unique opportunity for us.

Thanks very much for the time. This past summer, United launched an advertising network, depending on the 
success of that, is that something you'd look to be a fast follower on? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Edward Herman Bastian 
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
This is Ed. We'll have to see what it is. There's a lot of advertising and promotion being talked about. There's not 
a lot of doing on that front. We're very comfortable with where we sit in that space with the free Wi-Fi and Delta 
Sync and the continued investment in personalization. We're not looking to push ads or try to monetize our 
customers as much as provide greater value to them. And I think that's the sustainable strategy over time.

Ravi Shanker 
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q 
Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. You guys were pretty vocal on the 2Q call that the industry had to take 
out capacity in 3Q and 4Q. From where you sit right now looking at 1Q capacity, and how do you feel about that? 
Do you feel like it's in a good spot? Do you think there's more to come out? Or kind of how does that evolve? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
I don't think we want to comment about any individual, but in aggregate, I think we're encouraged by where the 
industry is finishing this year and likely that the way things have been loading into the schedule availability tapes, 
that there's probably more to come out of the first quarter. But that's a hypothesis, not a fact.

Ravi Shanker 
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q 
Understood. Maybe as a follow up for Dan, congrats on the investment-grade here. Obviously, kind of big change 
from the pandemic time. Where does that leave the balance sheet kind of going into 2025? And how do you think 
about continued debt pay down versus cash return? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah. That's another one we'll spend time within the next month. So stay tuned on that. But again, back to 
consistency, we're going to continue to be focused on cash generation, consistent reinvestment back into the 
business, and with primary focus on debt and debt pay down, continue to strengthen the balance sheet, and 
effectively returning capital that way to investors through the accretion of the equity value of enterprise value.

 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Sheila Kahyaoglu 
Analyst, Jefferies LLC Q 
Hi. Good morning, Ed, Glen, Dan. Maybe two questions on premium. So if you look at premium cabin, its 
outperformed main cabin by 9 points over the past two quarters versus the previous trend of about 5 points. So 
first, I guess, can we talk about the spread? How long does that continue? Does main cabin catch up, or does 
premium have more to go? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
I'll take a stab at it. And, Dan, feel free to add your comments. I think it's a little bit of both. I think we've got main 
cabin underperforming, and that was really what drove capacity rationalization, I think, by the industry. Because if 
all you have is main cabin, you need to fix supply so you can get your unit revenues moving in the right direction. 
So I think we've seen that occurring right now and through the end of the year as those incremental cuts, capacity 
cuts, come into play. So I would assume that main cabin as we exit this year is starting to improve on the margin, 
but we also think there's more to go on the premium products. 
 
And I think, not to keep harping in on saying, come next month and join us for our Investor Day, but I think we'll be 
able to unveil why and how we think those can continue to improve over the medium and long term. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Daniel C. Janki 
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yes. Agree with both.

Sheila Kahyaoglu 
Analyst, Jefferies LLC Q 
And maybe the second question on that same topic. How do we think about the margin implications that the 
benefit in the main cabin catch up, which is clearly underperforming? Does it have a lesser impact on margins as 
we head into 2025? Or do you see premium and main continuing to grow at the same rate? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, I think – yeah, I think that's a – hard to say that we parse that out at this point in time. But I think what we're 
seeing is a much more constructive backdrop in both, whether or not it's the continued increase in business travel, 
as well as better distribution of our products and services in the premium cabins, or whether or not it's the better 
supply/demand balance in coach. But I think all those are coming into play as we head towards the end of this 
year.

Hey. Good morning, everyone. Most of my questions have already been asked. But I know I've kind of asked this 
on some past calls, but as we prepare for Investor Day next month and we think about the long-term free cash 
flow generation potential at Delta, Dan, can you just give us a sense of kind of when you become a cash 
taxpayer? And I think when you were a cash taxpayer pre-pandemic, your cash tax rate was in the low to mid-
teens. Does that still hold? Any color around that would be helpful. Thank you.

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Certainly, I'm happy to talk about cash taxes. It's a pleasure to actually be in a position, where [ph] in a planner 
(00:46:43) horizon, we will be a cash taxpayer. We expect to start paying some cash taxes next year as we've 
burned through the deferred tax asset positions that we've had, and we'll step into that over the next three years. 
And as you think about the stabilized cash tax rate, it really depends also on where tax policy goes, legislation 
goes, but think of it as it will progress to the high-teens, maybe the low-20s, but we still have many years in front 
of us related to that.

Andrew G. Didora 
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc. Q 
Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just a second one for Glen, just from – Transatlantic commentary seems 
very positive, seems like competitive capacity there looks pretty constructive from what we can see in schedules.

How would you rank the potential for Transatlantic revenue generation amongst all of your entities as we head 
into 2025? Thank you. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Yeah. I think Domestic is going to be quite strong given the capacity levels that we're exiting the year from, and I 
think Transatlantic will follow right behind. We have a lot of lapsing in Pacific in terms of capacity that we've added 
this year that I think will be better next year. So we had some uplift there. And then, there's been – again, we 
haven't talked about it much on this call, but there's been a significant amount of capacity rationalization in the 
leisure markets in Latin America, which I think should serve us well. So hopefully, we're looking at all of them 
turning into positives sometime next year, but I'd say, probably Domestic and Transatlantic being the strongest of 
the two.

Andrew G. Didora 
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc. Q 
That's great. Thank you. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Julie Stewart

Matthew, we'll now go to our final analyst question. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  
 

Operator: Certainly. Your next question is coming from Stephen Trent from Citi. Your line is live. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Stephen Darrell Trent 
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Q 
Good morning, everyone, and thanks very much for taking my question. Just wanted to dig in a little more. You 
mentioned your technology investments. I think I recall seeing Delta TechOps is using drones to help with 
equipment inspections. And could you mention maybe sort of broadly thinking how you may deploy innovative 
solutions across your business. Thank you. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Sure, Stephen. Again, we'll talk a little bit about this next month. But we have, I think, great opportunities with the 
technology foundation that we've built. We are in the very early stages of understanding the potential of AI for our 
business, and there's no question that there are some really interesting applications to drive better predictive 
modeling and opportunities, whether that's on the revenue front or on the efficiency in the cost front. And the thing 
with AI is that you need to, especially as you scale it, you need to make sure that your foundation is clean and 
reliable. And that's what we've been working on doing. So big opportunities to come, and stay tuned. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Stephen Darrell Trent 
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Q 
Super. Well, I'm looking forward to November. And thank you very much for the time.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 10-Oct-2024 
 
Julie Stewart 
Vice President-Investor Relations & Corporate Development, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
That will wrap the analyst portion of the call. I'll now turn it over to the Tim Mapes to start the media questions. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Tim Mapes 
Senior Vice President & Chief Communications Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Thank you, Julie. Matthew, if you don't mind, while we transition from the analysts to members of the media, if we 
could repeat the instructions and – for the call queue, please? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  
 

Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Your first question is coming from Leslie Josephs from 
CNBC. Your line is live. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Leslie Josephs 
Reporter, CNBC LLC Q 
Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just curious on the shoulder season you mentioned, 
Glen, I just wanted to clarify, you said that September and October are more like the previous July and August 
because of the weather changes? And then also wanted to ask about your premium product offerings. You've 
been investing a lot, obviously the LA and New York Delta One Lounges and just lounges in general. What do you 
thinking about for hard products, specifically Delta One? And what are the features that customers are asking for 
that maybe you're not offering now? Or what are some of the areas that you'd like to improve there in the cabin? 
Thanks. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Well, Leslie, what I think I said was October and December are the better months, and November is the one that's 
off trend because of the election. So I think that's what I said on the earlier call. Yeah. September, too. That 
October looked a lot like September. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Leslie Josephs 
Reporter, CNBC LLC Q 
Okay. I thought you mentioned something about the heat in Europe. I wasn't sure if that's like that permanent 
shift... 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Oh, no. That was the Transatlantic demand profile is switching from July and August being super peak to more of 
not having as big a peak in July and August and moving that travel into September and October. So it's an 
interesting change. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Leslie Josephs 
Reporter, CNBC LLC Q 
Got it. It is hot. And then on the hard product, what is your thinking there especially for the front of the cabin?

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 10-Oct-2024 
 
I think we have a whole Investor Day next month that we want to talk about it. So I don't think we don't want to 
unveil it here on this call, but hopefully, you have time to join us. And we'll talk a lot about where we want to take 
premium products in the next four to five years at that meeting. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Leslie Josephs 
Reporter, CNBC LLC Q 
Okay. Thanks.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Alison Sider from Wall Street Journal. Your line is live. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Alison Sider 
Reporter, The Wall Street Journal Q 
Hey. Thanks so much. Curious, had an air traffic control airspace question. Curious what you're seeing in New 
York, if the shift to Philadelphia is kind of how that's working out for your other New York operations, if you're 
seeing the hope for benefits or if you've had any problems there? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Peter W. Carter 
Executive Vice President-External Affairs, Chief Legal Officer & Corporate Secretary, Delta Air Lines, Inc.  A 
Hey, Ali. It's Peter Carter. So we were with the FAA about a week ago talking about all of this, and what I would 
say is that the N90 shift seems to have gone well. But we still have the same constraints in the New York airspace 
that we've had for the last couple years. So as we all know, there's a shortage of air traffic controllers, and I think 
the FAA is obviously engaged in trying to solve that. But it's going to take some time. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Alison Sider 
Reporter, The Wall Street Journal Q 
And is New York kind of still the major – that airspace kind of like the major bottleneck in the system? Like how 
much does that ripple out to the rest of the country? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Peter W. Carter 
Executive Vice President-External Affairs, Chief Legal Officer & Corporate Secretary, Delta Air Lines, Inc.  A 
It's New York. Florida we're seeing some constraints as well. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Alison Sider 
Reporter, The Wall Street Journal Q 
Thank you. 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Tim Mapes 
Senior Vice President & Chief Communications Officer, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A

line is live.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 10-Oct-2024 
 
Thank you. Earlier when you were talking about the rebuilding the core hubs and you made a reference to getting 
all of your regional feedback up, can you give just sort of an overview of what's happened with your regional feed 
since the pandemic and how that – like maybe what level it dropped to and how it's rebuilt? 
 .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Glen William Hauenstein 
President, Delta Air Lines, Inc. A 
Certainly. As you know, pilot constraints, as the majors were hiring early in the recovery period, put a lot of strain 
on availability of pilot crews for the regional carriers, all of them. And we've been working very closely with them. 
And now that the industry growth are – patterns are back to more normalized requirements or next year, we think 
the industry will generate about 5,000 new pilot jobs, which is about what it did in 2019. So returning to more 
normalized pilot hiring across the industry. That the dearth of capacity in terms of pilots available for regionals is 
dissipating very quickly. And so in the beginning, we probably had only 35% to 40% of our capacity available. 
Most recently this past year it's been more like 65% to 70%, and by next summer, we think that will be back to 
100% of the capacity that we had available in 2019.
