Robert E. Sulentic 
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. 

Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, it's important to note that Emma and I regularly 
reference our performance relative to expectations during these quarterly calls. In all cases, the expectations we 
are referencing are based on the outlook we provided during our most recent quarterly call. 
 
We started 2024 by delivering core earnings that exceeded our expectations. This was driven in part by solid net 
revenue growth. However, several notable elements of our performance differed from our plan going into the year. 
I'll touch on three of them: leasing strength, property sales weakness and cost pressure. 
 
Leasing outperformed expectations, driven by office leasing growth globally that reflects a resilient economy and 
companies making progress on bringing their employees back to the office. At the same time, persistent inflation 
kept interest rates higher than expected, which led to underperformance in our property sales transaction activity. 
 
Our Global Workplace Solutions segment again delivered double-digit net revenue growth, even as margins fell 
short of expectations. Our costs in GWS have increased at an unacceptable rate and we have initiated actions to 
bring them quickly back into line with revenue trajectory. 
 
These actions include consolidating the management of Advisory and GWS under our Chief Operating Officer, 
Vikram Kohli, with an explicit focus on rapidly wringing out unnecessary costs and better integrating the solutions 
we deliver for occupier clients. Significant progress has already been made on these efforts. 
 
We expect GWS' cost challenges to be mostly mitigated by year end, with the majority of our actions being 
initiated in the second quarter. As a result, this segment remains poised to achieve mid-teens SOP growth for the 
full year. 
 
Looking across the whole business, we remain confident that we will generate core earnings per share in the 
range of $4.25 to $4.65. Our confidence is underpinned by our Resilient Businesses' continued strong 
performance, our rapid actions on costs and the fact that Advisory Services remains on track to achieve its growth 
target for the year despite a more uncertain economic outlook. 
 
Emma will discuss the specifics of our outlook in greater detail after reviewing our first quarter performance. 
Emma?

Emma E. Giamartino

Thanks, Bob. At a consolidated level, core EBITDA was in line with our expectations as slight outperformance in 
REI and lower than expected corporate costs offset margin underperformance in GWS. Advisory SOP performed 
as anticipated. Core EPS exceeded expectation due to a one-time tax benefit.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 03-May-2024 
 
Please turn to slide 6 for a review of the Advisory segment. Despite an interest rate outlook that steadily 
worsened throughout the quarter, Advisory net revenue rose 3%, consistent with expectations, bolstered by its 
first quarter of transactional revenue growth in six quarters and growth from every line of business except property 
sales. 
 
Leasing revenue rose in every region and global growth exceeded our expectations. Office leasing grew by 
double digits globally as a resilient economy and progress on return to office plans have emboldened tenants to 
make occupancy decisions. We have continued to see strong momentum in US leasing in April. 
 
Financial services companies are leading the recovery, with active demand up more than 20% year-over-year 
across the US gateway markets, reflecting their considerable progress in bringing employees back to the office. 
Tech companies continue to lag with demand 50% below pre-COVID levels. 
 
Globally, property sales revenue declined 11%, with weakness in the US and APAC. EMEA is showing early 
signs of recovery, with sales up 8% year-over-year, where growth was led by the UK, where property values have 
made more progress towards resetting as well as Spain. 
 
We saw strong growth in our loan origination business despite continued weak property sales activity. Our growth 
was driven by loan origination activity and escrow income. Loan origination fees grew 16%, primarily driven by a 
heavier weighting of higher margin loans sourced with debt funds. Escrow income as de minimis in a low interest 
rate environment, but acts as a hedge in the current economic environment. We saw this in Q1 when escrow 
income increased nearly threefold from Q1 2023. 
 
The remaining businesses within Advisory, property management, loan servicing and valuations together grew 
revenue by 5%, as expected. For the full year, we expect these businesses to deliver low double-digit revenue 
growth led by property management, particularly as the Brookfield office assets are onboarded beginning in Q2. 
 
Moving to Advisory SOP, I'll call out two one-time impacts that weighed on margins in the quarter. First, we 
experienced elevated medical claims that should reverse later in the year; and second, we trued up interest 
income owed to a small number of clients. Absent these one-time costs and excluding OMSRs, margin would 
have improved 25 basis points versus the prior year Q1. 
 
Please turn to slide 7 as I discuss the GWS segment. Net revenue rose 10%, in line with our expectations. 
Facilities management and project management net revenue were up 11% and 7%, respectively. Project 
management faced a particularly difficult comparison as net revenue surged 18% in Q1 2023. We had a second 
consecutive quarter of very strong business wins with a healthy balance between new clients and expansions. 
 
As of the end of Q1, we already have commitments for nearly $900 million of anticipated net revenue growth, 
representing the significant majority of our projected growth for the full year. Having already locked in this much of 
our expected growth gives us confidence in achieving our full year revenue plan. 
 
SOP margin on net revenue declined by 90 basis points from the prior year Q1. More than half of the decline 
reflects a one-time impact to gross profit margin from the same unusually large medical claims we saw in 
Advisory. The remainder is related to two areas of higher costs. 
 
First, we've made investments in certain initiatives that we are discontinuing. Second, our operating expenses 
have crept up over time as we've expanded into new sectors, entered new geographies and added redundant 
costs related to recent M&A.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 03-May-2024 
 
 
In response, we are taking a fresh look at GWS' cost structure and are already executing substantial actions 
across the business. The benefit of these cost actions as well as our elevated new business wins will be apparent 
in Q3 and particularly Q4. 
 
Please turn to slide 8 for a discussion of the Real Estate Investments segment. This segment's significantly lower 
earnings were slightly better than we had expected. As we previously discussed, last year's first quarter benefited 
from an unusually large gain on a development portfolio, while project sales activity remained subdued in the 
current higher cap rate environment. The value of our development in-process portfolio increased by $3 billion to 
$19 billion in total due to the start of a particularly large fee development project. 
 
Investment management performance was in line with expectations and below the prior year, largely due to 
slightly lower AUM. Fundraising activity was up 50% compared with Q1 2023. Investors are showing strong 
appetite for enhanced return and infrastructure strategies, although we expect fundraising to slow from the first 
quarter's robust levels. Recent fundraising is not yet reflected in AUM, which fell modestly in the quarter to $144 
billion, driven by negative mark to market and FX movements. 
 
Before turning to our outlook, I want to briefly touch on free cash flow. Cash flow conversion has improved for the 
second consecutive quarter and we are beginning to see the reversal of incentive compensation headwinds that 
we experienced last year, driven by record earnings in 2022. We expect to generate approximately $1 billion of 
free cash flow this year and end the year with around one turn of net leverage. 
 
Now please turn to our updated outlook on slide 9. Although interest rate expectations have changed significantly 
and the economic outlook is more uncertain, as Bob noted, we remain confident that we'll earn core EPS in the 
range of $4.25 to $4.65 this year. 
 
Within Advisory, we continue to expect mid-teens SOP growth unless economic conditions take a sharp turn for 
the worst. Our base case scenario envisions that the economy remains resilient and interest rate cuts are 
delayed. Under these conditions, faster leasing growth compensates for subdued sales activity. As Bob 
mentioned, we also still anticipate mid-teens SOP growth for the GWS segment. SOP growth will be very heavily 
weighted to the second half as recent wins are onboarded and we see the impact of our cost cutting efforts. 
 
In REI, we now expect a more pronounced SOP decline, given continued higher interest rate. However, the range 
of outcomes is wider than normal with the key variable being whether the market for development project sales 
improves late in the year. While REI SOP is unusually depressed right now, we expect these businesses to lead 
our growth once market conditions inevitably improve. 
 
Additionally, as part of our broad-based efficiency efforts, our COO, Vikram Kohli, and I are taking a hard look at 
corporate costs and expect them to be lower for the year than initially anticipated. 
 
Assuming the midpoint of our outlook range, we expect to generate nearly 70% of full year core EPS in the 
second half of the year. This heavier than normal weighting reflects the expected cadence of GWS revenue and 
cost reductions and a slight recovery of our property sales and development businesses later in the year. 
 
Our expectations for profit growth in 2024 are now driven to a greater degree by the cost components of our 
business, which are within our control. As such, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our earnings outlook 
under a range of reasonable economic assumption.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 03-May-2024 
 
With that operator, we'll open the line for questions. 
 

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION 
 
 
Operator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question is 
coming from Anthony Paolone of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Anthony Paolone 
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q 
Great. Thanks. Good morning. I guess first question relates to just the guidance at your midpoint and the 
comments here around 70% in the back half. So I guess it implicitly means that 2Q goes down notably. And so I 
was wondering if you could just give a little bit more color on that whether EBITDA also goes down sequentially or 
if that's an EPS matter? Just anything there. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
So, Anthony, I do want to walk through the components of our 2024 outlook again. And the headline is that we've 
– the midpoint of our outlook is unchanged, but I do want to walk through the components that were – that built to 
that outcome. So in the Advisory line, you saw our SOP growth trajectory is in line with what we talked about in 
February. However, the path to get there is slightly different because what we're seeing is that leasing is stronger 
than we had anticipated because of the health of the economy and sales is weaker as rate cuts have been 
pushed out. 
 
On the GWS side, again, you see that our SOP target for the year is unchanged. We have consistently talked 
about the fact that our revenue growth this year in GWS will be back-end loaded as these large lumpy enterprise 
contracts get onboarded in the second half of the year. And additionally, what you're seeing is we're going to take 
out costs from GWS. And so we're going to see margin expansion in the second half of the year. 
 
On the REI front, we are expecting a slight decline versus last year and that talk about a 10% decline, but what's 
important to note about REI is that there is a wide range of outcomes. And right now, we're anticipating a large 
number of monetizations in Q4 within our development business. And as you know, there is uncertainty around 
when those will hit and if they'll get pushed into 2025 or stay in 2024. And then on the corporate segment level, 
those costs are coming in lower than we had initially anticipated. 
 
So if you put all of that together, you would get to an EPS midpoint that is higher than what we've indicated. But 
as we said in February, we do have some conservatism embedded in our outlook because of the wide range of 
outcomes, especially in Advisory and in development. 
 
As for Q2, yes, you'll see a decline year-over-year and that's simply because both in GWS and in Advisory, that 
revenue growth and margin expansion is back-end – is second half loaded. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Anthony Paolone 
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q 
All right. So even sequentially, though, like, does EBITDA kind of move down sequentially from 1Q to 2Q, 
because it just seems a little bit counter to the normal seasonality? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 03-May-2024 
 
Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
No, EBITDA will not be declining from Q1 to Q2. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Anthony Paolone 
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q 
Okay. And should we think about just full year EBITDA margins still being up versus 2023 at this point? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
Yeah. So EBITDA margin should be up across both Advisory and GWS and at the consolidated level. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Anthony Paolone 
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q 
Okay. And then just last one, yeah, you mentioned a large development project [ph] because you saw the roughly 
$3 billion bounce (00:16:59) in developments underway, but it sounds like that's a fee deal. So I'm just wondering 
if you can give us a little bit more detail, because it's a big increase and I always looked at that as being 
something that could drive promotes and your share of gains, but it sounds like maybe there's also like fee 
projects in there as well where you may not participate. Just maybe some more details there. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
Yeah. The significant majority of that increase is related to an extremely large industrial deal in the Sun Belt. It's 
over 2 million square feet. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Anthony Paolone 
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q 
Okay. Thank you. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  
 

Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Steve Sakwa 
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC Q 
Yeah. Thanks. I just wanted to touch on capital allocation. Obviously, you had the J&J deal in the first quarter. I 
noticed you didn't buy back any stock. I guess, first, were you in much of a blackout period, which you didn't really 
– weren't allowed to buy back stock or was that more of a conscious decision just based on where the stock was? 
And how should we be thinking about, I guess, stock repurchases going forward as well as capital deployment in 
the more kind of economic uncertain environment? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
Steve, what you saw in Q1 was related to J&J. We've always talked about we're balancing M&A and share 
repurchases and our priority is to deploy capital towards M&A and strategic M&A. And so in Q1, we pulled back 
on repurchases as we were executing that transaction. We have started repurchasing shares in Q2 to a small 
extent.

CBRE Group, Inc. (CBRE) Corrected Transcript 
Q1 2024 Earnings Call 03-May-2024 
 
 
And for the balance of the year, you should expect that to continue. As we do more M&A, you'll see that come 
through. But if we're not seeing a strong conversion of our M&A pipeline, you'll see us repurchase shares as long 
as our prices remaining attractive. And our goal is, on a consistent basis, to deploy at least our free cash flow on 
an annual basis. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Steve Sakwa 
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC Q 
Free cash flow in total? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
Yes. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Steve Sakwa 
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC Q 
Okay. But I mean the J&J deal was a large chunk of probably your free cash flow for the year, so that kind of puts 
limited buyback activities in totality. Is that a fair way to think about it? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
That is fair. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Steve Sakwa 
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC Q 
Okay. And then, I guess, Bob, just on the transaction side, it's not the biggest line item, but it probably has more 
to do with the sentiment around the stock and how people think about the business, even though you certainly 
diversified the company quite a bit and made it more resilient. I'm just curious, what are you kind of hearing from 
the field in terms of the transactions and just rates? And is it more the actual Fed cut? Is it more about stability in 
the 10-year? I mean, I guess, is it the level of rate or is it more of the direction of rate and the uncertainty over that 
that creates kind of the pause in the market? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Robert E. Sulentic 
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
Steve, first of all, there's two areas of our business where it really comes through in our numbers. One is our sales 
business and one is our development business where we sell assets and generate profits from that. At the 
beginning of the year, the assumption of our teams was more bullish about the trajectory of interest rates than it is 
now, without a doubt. That shouldn't surprise anybody. I'm sure that's true across the whole market. It's also true 
of buyers and sellers of assets in general. And as a result, it's just slowed down activity on the sell side. 
 
And what we're thinking about as a seller of assets, in Trammell Crow Company in our development business, is 
exactly what others are thinking about. They've decided to stay on the sidelines longer. We've decided to stay on 
the sidelines longer. We've got a portfolio of great assets that we're going to sell at some point, but we're not 
going to sell them until we think the environment is such that we can get the pricing we want. And it's hard to get 
that pricing when the interest rates are higher. And that's really what you're seeing, and the sentiment is, in fact, 
different now than it was at the beginning of the year.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 03-May-2024 
 
 
Of course, the flip side is it's different because the economy is better and we have this very big leasing business 
that's benefited from that. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Steve Sakwa 
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC Q 
Okay. Thanks. And then last just, Emma, I just wanted to clarify, I think you said that – maybe I missed it, that 
there was a tax benefit in the reported core EPS number this quarter, but I don't know if you sort of quantified it. 
And I don't recall seeing a specific mention of that in the release. So could you just clarify that, please? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
Correct. It's about a $50 million tax benefit in the quarter that will not repeat. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Steve Sakwa 
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC Q 
Great. Thank you. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  
 

Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Jade Rahmani of KBW. Please go ahead. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Jade Rahmani 
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. Q 
Thank you very much. Taking a step back, from my vantage point, the big growth opportunities would seem to be 
infrastructure, investment management and commercial mortgage. Could you comment if you agree with that and 
where you see the most potential? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Robert E. Sulentic 
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
Project management, in general, Jade, is a big, big growth opportunity, project and program management, not 
limited to infrastructure. Corporates, we're doing a lot of work. There's work in natural resources. That's – we see 
that as a well into the double digits enduring grower and it's now become a very big business for us. 
 
Our whole outsourcing business, our whole GWS business, is benefiting from a long-term secular double-digit 
growth profile and we expect that to continue. We expect that to continue for our – what we call, our local GWS 
business and for our enterprise business. So that's going to be a strong grower for us. 
 
We do think – if you look at where we're at with our development business and our investment management 
business, they should be – Emma commented on this in her remarks, they should lead growth over the next few 
years just because of where they're at. Those businesses are really at a cyclical low point. 
 
And if you follow the – yes, we had a big add to our in-process development through a fee deal, which – by the 
way, that's a deal that Trammell Crow Company and Turner & Townsend are doing together. And before the 
Turner & Townsend arrangement, we would have been less well positioned to do that. And you should see more 
of that. But that big portfolio of in-process projects for Trammell Crow Company has a lot of pent up profitability in 
it. So you should see a lot of profit growth coming out of that business. And yes, we think our mortgage business 
is positioned for a lot of growth.

So we have confidence right across our business in our ability to grow it. And I can tell you, we're going through a 
deep dive with our strategy team and some outside help, looking at our strategy, we've got nine lines of business 
that we're in. We're the global leader in six of them. We're the domestic US leader in development and we are 
bullish about growth in all of them, not equally bullish, and I spiked out the ones that we're more bullish about. But 
we think the growth profile for our business – the enduring growth profile is well into double digits, certainly in the 
next several years, but longer term as well. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Jade Rahmani 
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. Q 
Thank you very much. Switching to GWS, the comment around the pipeline, that seems new. So I think investors 
are trying to figure out how to interpret that. Could you give some color as to how much relates to J&J, which I 
believe was expected to add annual revenue of $825 million? And also, just the regular way double-digit growth 
that was expected, how much of the $900 million is new business that would be in addition to prior expectations? 
And then secondly, the medical claims and overall cost controls, if you could provide any color there and why that 
surprised management? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
Yeah. And Jade, on the pipeline comment, can you just give us more on what you're seeing that's – or what 
you're hearing that's different from what we've said previously? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Jade Rahmani 
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. Q 
Well, the $900 million that was mentioned, we're trying to understand if that's accretive to prior – to our prior 
expectations. I think in our forecast, we have about $10.2 billion of net revenue, which is $1.25 billion above last 
year and that includes some new revenue coming in from J&J, which probably would contribute $500 million to 
$600 million for the year. So stripping that out, I'm trying to compare that to the $900 million and just see how 
much of that is really new information versus prior. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
Got it. Okay. So that $900 million is not a new information. When we provided our outlook at the beginning of the 
year for GWS, it was for that $900 million of – and more of net revenue growth that was going to come into GWS 
in the back half of the year. And that's why we've been talking about the growth accelerating above trend on the 
revenue line in Q3 and Q4. 
 
That $900 million does not include J&J. J&J for the year is expected to contribute a little less than $450 million of 
net revenue. We closed that towards the end of Q1 and it's had a very small impact to Q1, given that we had only 
a month of revenue and profits from J&J. And so that $900 million is simply the conversion of our pipeline. We've 
talked about really strong conversion and strong pipelines in – throughout last year and in Q4 and in Q1. So this is 
just articulation of how much is locked in, which gives us confidence that we're going to achieve our revenue 
forecast for GWS for the year. 
 
On the cost front, you're right that the majority of the cost impact has been at the gross profit line and it is related 
to those employee medical claims coming in higher than we expected, but this is – we believe this is a seasonality 
issue or this is a cadence of those claims. I mean, it's a new unique situation related to the fact that we changed

healthcare providers for our company over a year ago. And over the first year, what typically happens is, as 
employees are looking for new healthcare providers, there our claims down. And so we knew they were going to 
tick up this year, we just didn't expect it to happen in Q1. And so that should reverse in the remainder of the year.

Jade Rahmani 
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. Q 
That's great. One last one would just be around GWS and office. I often get the question as to when the 
rationalization in the office sector in terms of reduction in square footage would impact that business. Do you see 
that as a potential headwind, realizing also that there's a lot of growth opportunities, which you've commented on? 
But just office, in particular, would that be a potential headwind? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Robert E. Sulentic 
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
Yeah. Jade, it's not a headwind that we haven't contemplated in our comments about expected growth for that 
business. And I made the comment last quarter that we don't have a single client in GWS that I'm aware of, and 
we work with the biggest tech companies, the biggest financial companies, et cetera, that doesn't view their office 
space as a critical asset for the operations of their business. They're all trying to get their people together more. 
They're all trying to get people to spend more time in the office and less time at home. And they're very focused 
on using those portfolios – those office portfolios to get that done. 
 
Yes, most of them are trying to figure out if they can operate with less office space. But to get from more to less 
office space, they're also thinking about reconfiguring their offices and upgrading their offices and taking different 
office space. That's why you saw leasing go up. A lot of companies are trying to – particularly in the gateway 
markets, in the better office buildings where we play aggressively, they're trying to put their employees in more 
attractive space. 
 
So there's nothing going on there that would cause us to think that there's a downside dimension that we haven't 
contemplated already.

Stephen Sheldon 
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC Q 
Hey. Thanks for taking my questions, and just one for me. Great to see the improvement in office leasing. So I 
just wanted to ask about the other major leasing sector industrial. Are you seeing things there get any better or 
worse? And what do you think it take for a leasing activity to stabilize and return to growth at some point? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Robert E. Sulentic 
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
Well, we expect it to grow slightly this year and likely more next year. There's some choppiness in certain coastal 
markets. But the fact of the matter is some big occupiers are coming back into the market aggressively, some 
well-known companies. And we aren't of the mind that leasing for the industrial asset class is going to decline this

year or next year. We feel good about it. It's not going to have the explosive growth that it had in 2021, et cetera, 
but it's not going to be a declining leasing business, in our view. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Stephen Sheldon 
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC Q 
Great. Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Michael Griffin of Citi. Please go ahead. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Michael A. Griffin 
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Q 
Great. Thanks. I wanted to go back to the commentary around office leasing. I think it definitely seems positive 
relative to what maybe our expectations were. But could you unpack that in terms of where you're seeing the 
leasing gets done? Is it mostly on the trophy and Class A products or is it spread out between the higher quality 
stuff and then commodity space? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Robert E. Sulentic 
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
A lot in the higher quality assets, Michael. I mean, we're seeing record rental rates in some of the bigger markets 
in the higher quality assets, New York as an example. We're seeing financial institutions and business services 
companies, in particular, taking more space. Tech is way down. But for us to have this leasing picture in tech be 
off the way it is, we view that as good news for us because there is nobody that pays attention to tech that thinks 
long run. They won't, A, get more of their people back in the office, and B, grow – be disproportionate growers 
relative to the rest of the economy. So we expect that part of it to come back. 
 
And then there are some second-tier markets [ph] that they (00:33:05) may not be second tier forever, but what's 
going on in Nashville is pretty well documented and there are other places that have that flavor to them. So those 
are the things that are contributing to what we're seeing in office leasing. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Michael A. Griffin 
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Q 
Thanks for that, Bob. And Emma, you talked about, I think, the $50 million tax benefit in the quarter. Adjusting for 
this, I think it would be about $0.61 of earnings in the quarter. Is that the right run rate and cadence that we 
should think about to get to the midpoint of the full year guide or how should we think about that? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
For the tax rate specifically for the year, it should be about, I think, a little over 19%. Excluding the tax benefit, it's 
around 22%. Does that answer your question? [ph] Or you need (00:34:01) specific about... 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Michael A. Griffin 
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Q 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, that does. And then just one last one. I noticed that you didn't provide the 2025 outlook, I 
think, relative to last quarter in your presentation. Is the expectation still to return to peak earnings growth in 2025 
or get close to it? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 03-May-2024 
 
Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
Yes. And all of our discussion around the path to reaching peak earnings in 2025 was to provide a framework 
around how we're thinking about the trajectory of our business, but that path has remained unchanged and we 
believe it's achievable where we sit today. And that's driven by continued low double-digit growth across our 
resilient lines of business at the SOP level. And then on the transactional side, the SOP does not need to get 
back to 2019 levels for us to achieve that record level of EPS next year. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Michael A. Griffin 
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Q 
Great. That's it from me. Thank you. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  
 

Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Peter Abramowitz of Jefferies. Please go ahead. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Peter Abramowitz 
Analyst, Jefferies LLC Q 
Yes. Thank you. So most of my questions have been asked, but just one on the transaction markets here. 
Cushman mentioned on their call, it seemed to be a pretty kind of direct relationship in that investment sales for 
them at least were stronger to begin the first quarter when the rate outlook was much better and it kind of slowed 
in March and April as rate expectations have gone up. So just trying to get a sense from what you see in your 
business in terms of the relationship between rate expectations near term and how things are happening on the 
ground. Just curious your comments on kind of what you saw in the business as it directly relates from a rate 
perspective? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
So it varies across regions, in the US that is. What we saw later in the quarter, there was an uptick as rates 
increased. But in EMEA and APAC, we didn't see that trend, just given that there's different dynamics going on 
there and EMEA is ahead of the curve in terms of their recovery in the sales market. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Peter Abramowitz 
Analyst, Jefferies LLC Q 
Got it. And then one other on the transaction market. Could you just talk generally about kind of the role of 
distressed sales in the market? Have you seen that kind of start to thaw at all, whether in the first quarter or going 
forward? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Robert E. Sulentic 
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
There's been some distressed debt activity, selling of distressed debt. There's also been some activity, I'd call it 
more pending activity of selling debt portfolios that aren't distressed just because people's concern about their 
debt portfolio. They may sell non-distressed portfolios at a slight discount. 
 
The assets that are really distressed are office buildings, B and C office buildings, and there aren't a lot of buyers 
in the market for those assets right now. We do expect that there will be buyers for those assets in the market, but 
the pricing probably has to come down more than it has.

All right. That's helpful. Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Raymond James. Please go ahead. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Patrick Joseph O'Shaughnessy 
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Q 
Hey, good morning. Just one question from me. In your prepared remarks, you spoke to investments in certain 
initiatives that you are discontinuing. Can you provide some color on what those are and to the extent that they 
were strategically important to you or not? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Robert E. Sulentic 
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
Yeah, Patrick, they weren't strategically important. We may have at one time thought they were more strategically 
important than we do now. In fact, that's almost inevitable given that we were spending money on them and we've 
stopped. But what happens in a business that's growing, and even though our sector and our company have 
slowed down considerably in the last couple of years, our GWS business hasn't. That business has been growing. 
And when you have a growing business, you tend to look for opportunities to add initiatives, to address the growth 
opportunity. You also tend to, because you have a lot of growth opportunity, take your eye off them a little bit 
when they don't work. And we built up some of that across GWS. 
 
The fact of the matter is, though, if you look at that business for the quarter, that was a, Emma, $5.8 billion 
revenue business. The cost problem that we had net of this medical issue that Emma described is in the $15 
million to $20 million range spread across $5.5 billion plus business. So it's lots of little things here and there. 
None of our strategically important efforts in that business have changed in any significant way. I mentioned 
earlier in my comments, we have a big strategy effort underway with our strategy team now looking at the parts of 
the business where we think there is real growth opportunity and where we intend to invest in a big way. And our 
view of the growth opportunity with the enterprise FM customers, with project management for corporates, with 
project management for green energy and for infrastructure with our local FM business, none of our broad-based 
growth aspirations or growth initiatives have been altered as a result of the cost issues that we're after now and 
what we've been talking about. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Patrick Joseph O'Shaughnessy 
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Q 
Perfect. Thank you very much. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  
 

Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Anthony Paolone of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Anthony Paolone 
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q 
Thanks. I think you may have just answered this, Bob. I was just going to ask about that sort of the other half of 
the cost outside of medical that crept up on you in GWS, like kind of what happened there and just how it 
changed so quickly in like, I guess, the last few months. So I don't know if you had anything else to add on that 
front.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 03-May-2024 
 
Robert E. Sulentic 
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
Yeah. Anthony, I'll add, first of all, I really think to put it in perspective, you got to pay attention to the size of that 
number relative to the size of that business. Again, it's $15 million to $20 million of costs that hit the bottom line in 
a negative way relative to what we had expected if you ignore the medical, roughly. Is that right, Emma? Okay. 
And again, that was a $5.5-plus-billion business. It's a little bit of cost here and there. But it's something we stay 
on very closely, and we've taken aggressive action in that business to already address it. We think most of what 
will need to be done to correct the problems that we saw in that business will be done this quarter. And we've also 
done some rationalization across our whole services business, which resulted in those businesses reporting to 
our Chief Operating Officer, Vikram Kohli, and elimination of a leadership layer at the CEO level of those 
businesses, and there'll be other actions consistent with that down through the businesses. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Anthony Paolone 
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q 
Okay. Thank you. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  
 

Operator: Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to Bob Sulentic, Chairman and CEO, 
for closing comments.

Chair & Chief Executive Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. 

Thanks, everyone, for being with us. And we look forward to discussing our second quarter with you in about 90 
days.
