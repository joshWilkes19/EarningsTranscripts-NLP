Robert E. Sulentic 
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. 

Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. CBRE ended 2023 on a high note with fourth quarter year-over-
year operating profit growth across all three of our business segments. Even though 2023 was a difficult year for 
commercial real estate, we delivered the third highest full year earnings in CBRE's history as our resilient 
businesses continued their strong growth. This partly offset market-driven revenue declines in businesses that are 
sensitive to interest rates and debt availability. Emma will talk about our resilient businesses in greater detail at 
the beginning of her comments. 
 
We are committed to driving significant gains in all of our businesses with a particular focus on through-cycle 
resiliency and double-digit compound long-term earnings growth. Two recent wins highlight our progress. First, 
with the acquisition of J&J Worldwide Services in our GWS segment, we will increase our technical services 
capabilities for US federal government clients and open a mostly untapped channel in a difficult to penetrate 
market. This is a large market characterized by steady growth and long-term contracts. Second, our strategic 
partnership to provide property management services for Brookfield Properties' 65-million-square-foot US office 
portfolio is among the largest in the history of our sector. We believe there will be more opportunities of this nature 
which we are well-positioned to capture. 
 
We start 2024 with strong new business pipelines across our company. We also see attractive M&A and REI co-
investment opportunities. Investor and lender sentiment has improved and we anticipate this will lead to increased 
transaction volumes starting in the second half of the year when short-term interest rates are expected to fall. 
Against this backdrop, we expect to achieve core EPS of $4.25 to $4.65 in 2024, implying mid-teens percentage 
growth at the midpoint of the range. This broad range reflects the difficulty in predicting the precise timing of a 
recovery. It is notable that any outcome in this range would still be well below the long-term earnings potential of 
CBRE. 
 
With that, Emma will walk you through our results and outlook in more detail.

Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. 

Thanks, Bob. Before turning to segment performance, please turn to page 6 as I provide more insight into our 
resilient businesses. 
 
We've used this term regularly in our earnings calls over the last several quarters and it is now being used broadly 
in our sector. CBRE defines resilient businesses as those which hold up well in a downmarket cycle either 
because of their noncyclical characteristics or because they benefit from secular tailwinds. For CBRE, those 
businesses include the entire GWS segment, loan servicing, valuation, property management and recurring asset 
management fees in our investment management business. When we use this term, this is the group of 
businesses we are referencing. 
 
These resilient businesses in aggregate generated nearly $1.6 billion of SOP in 2023 and are expected to 
generate $1.8 billion of SOP in 2024. This will represent a sixfold increase from 2011, the first full year of market 
recovery following the global financial crisis. We expect 2024 to be the beginning of a market recovery, albeit a 
more gradual one. For context, our resilient businesses have grown SOP over three times as fast as our

transactional businesses since 2011. And they are expected to be nearly double the size of our entire business at 
a similar point in the last cycle. 
 
Please turn to page 7 as I review our results and outlook for 2024. The Class B Advisory segment net revenue 
and SOP essentially match the prior year's Q4. Leasing saw a slight uptick in revenue for the quarter driven 
mostly by EMEA and APAC. Globally, higher office leasing offset slightly less industrial activity. Within property 
sales, industrial and retail declined less than multifamily and office supported by healthier fundamentals. 
Commercial and mortgage origination revenue growth was attributable to interest earnings on escrow balances. 
The rest of our Advisory business lines together achieved a 6% net revenue increase. 
 
Turning to page 8. GWS had another strong quarter. Net revenue and SOP grew by double digits. Facilities 
management net revenue increased 14% for the quarter and 13% for the year. Most significantly, our sizable 
GWS local business has been increasing net revenue at or above a mid-teens clip and is well positioned to 
sustain this growth rate for the long term. Project management net revenue grew 11% for the quarter and 14% for 
the year. This was led by the large scale program management work being done globally by Turner & Townsend. 
Notably, we had record pipeline conversions to new GWS contracts during Q4 with a balanced mix of new clients 
and existing client expansions. 
 
Turning to page 9. SOP in our REI segment increased to $68 million in Q4, up from just $17 million in the prior 
year Q4. Development exceeded expectations due to the earlier-than-anticipated monetization of several assets 
in the US. Investment management operating profit rose significantly in Q4 driven by higher incentive fees and 
recurring asset management fees. Investment management AUM ended 2023 at $148 billion, up $3 billion for the 
quarter largely driven by favorable currency movements and modest net capital inflows which offset lower private 
asset values. For the year, AUM was down $2 billion. While asset value declines appear to be slowing, we 
anticipate values will remain under pressure in early 2024. 
 
Before turning to our 2024 outlook, I'll comment on our capital allocation strategy on slide 10. We are on track to 
deploy more than $2 billion of capital for the 12 months ending Q1 2024. This deployment includes M&A mostly in 
our resilient businesses and a record level of co-investment commitments in REI. By thoughtfully using our 
balance sheet, we made targeted opportunistic investments while other investors had been largely on the 
sidelines. These investments have been underwritten at returns well above our cost of capital and specifically our 
REI co-investments are projected to generate notably high returns. We also repurchased nearly 8 million shares 
in 2023 at a time when we believe they've attractively valued. 
 
Our 2024 capital deployment will be supported by improved free cash flow which we expect to total at least $1 
billion as certain headwinds reverse this year. As we've previously discussed, we had several large cash 
expenses in 2023, mostly timing related items such as cash variable compensation and cash income taxes tied to 
2022's record results that did not flex down with last year's lower earnings. We estimate that the reversal of these 
items alone will drive a $500 million benefit to free cash flow compared with last year. Taking all of this into 
consideration, we expect to end 2024 with net leverage around 1 turn. 
 
Now I'll review our 2024 outlook on slide 11. In the Advisory segment, we expect net revenue to increase by mid- 
to high single digits with mid-teens SOP growth. The expected margin improvement reflects fixed cost leverage 
and the benefit of ongoing cost reduction initiatives. Advisory accounts for about two-thirds of the $150 million run 
rate cost savings initiative announced last quarter with half of the benefit being realized in 2024. These savings 
offset cost growth elsewhere in Advisory this year notably from higher expected discretionary compensation tied 
to improved financial performance.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 15-Feb-2024 
 
We anticipate that capital markets revenue will grow by mid-single digits. Investor sentiment has improved in the 
last 90 days, reflecting a better interest rate outlook. Real estate allocations are approaching target levels. And 
this reflects an easing of the denominator effect as public equity markets have rebounded while private real estate 
values are being written down. We expect leasing to grow modestly in 2024. We're cautiously optimistic that the 
worst is over for office leasing particularly for Class A properties where we generate approximately two-thirds of 
our leasing revenue. 
 
Leading indicators from our data partner, VTS, indicate US office demand has been gradually turning up over the 
last six months. Growing consensus about an economic soft landing coupled with the apparent stabilization of 
office utilization rates may make more employers confident enough to commit to office leases. Additionally, 
leasing demand should remain relatively strong for industrial deals particularly for properties under 500,000 
square feet. Our remaining Advisory business lines together are expected to achieve low double-digit net revenue 
growth. 
 
In the GWS segment, we expect mid-teen SOP growth, including the expected partial year contribution from the 
J&J acquisition. Continued strong organic growth will be driven by broad demand across clients, sectors and 
geographies. The local business will lead growth in GWS, expected to generate more than $200 million of 
operating profit as we benefit further from our investments in this business. 
 
Our enterprise business is also seeing strong demand from both mature sectors like financial services as well as 
newer adopters of outsourcing such as industrial, healthcare and life sciences companies. Within project 
management, significant growth will be led by Turner & Townsend which is in the early stages of penetrating the 
US market. We anticipate seeing most of the revenue impact from our sizable Q4 wins in the second half of 2024 
as new clients are onboarded. And even with the record level of conversions in Q4, our GWS pipeline ended 2023 
10% higher than the prior year. 
 
Shifting to REI, we expect SOP in 2024 to be slightly below 2023's level. Note that last year's SOP included a 
single development portfolio sales which generated more than $100 million of profit in Q1. In investment 
management, we expect operating profit to increase modestly from 2023 as stabilizing market conditions drive 
higher promote fees and improved co-investment returns. 
 
We expect development operating profit will be subdued this year as the projects we expect to monetize will be 
sold at higher cap rates than we underwrote at the peak of the prior market cycle. At current market cap rates, we 
have hundreds of millions of dollars of operating profit embedded in our in-process portfolio and a pipeline of new 
opportunities with an attractive spread between our cost of development and current market values. 
 
On balance, we are cautiously optimistic about 2024. Our expectation of achieving core EPS of $4.25 to $4.65 is 
contingent on long-term interest rates remaining around current levels, the Fed proceeding with the anticipated 
short-term rate cuts and the US economy avoiding a recession. This year's earnings are likely to be more heavily 
weighted than usual to the second half. The third and fourth quarters are expected to account for approximately 
two-thirds of core EPS while the first quarter will contribute a mid-teens percentage of the annual total. 
 
This distribution is similar to what we experienced in 2021 when we also had a second half recovery. We continue 
to see a path to returning to our prior core EPS peak in 2025. That path is supported by continued double-digit 
growth in our resilient businesses and a gradual recovery in our transactional businesses. Importantly, CBRE can 
reach prior record earnings without our transactional businesses SOP rebounding to 2019 levels. 
 
With that, operator, please open the line for questions.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 15-Feb-2024 
 
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION 
 
 
Operator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first 
question is coming from Anthony Paolone from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Anthony Paolone 
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q 
Okay. Thank you. Good morning. I guess my first question is – I look at the guideposts for the various business 
lines. They seem pretty good from our vantage point. But just wondering if you could talk about things like the 
Corporate segment, taxes, interest expense, depreciation, all that sort of other stuff. And any year-over-year 
drags or ability to quantify any notable drags from those items as we think about going down to EPS? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
Yeah, Tony. So first to step back on our outlook and to just give context around the range, which I think will help 
get to the Corporate and below the line items. If you look at our segment level guidance, I think what you're 
seeing is that you likely get to an EPS that's slightly above the midpoint of our range. 
 
And what we've baked into the midpoint of our EPS guidance is some level of conservatism given that rates have 
continued to be volatile especially in the past few weeks. So safe to assume on the Corporate cost level, the 
Corporate segment level that that is going to uptick slightly but not as much as the numbers that you're looking at 
might imply. And the reason Corporate will uptick slightly is because primarily because our bonuses, discretionary 
compensation will reset to levels that are in line with improved financial performance. 
 
And then I'll comment on the range of our outlook. The pieces that we have a high level of conviction around is 
our growth in our resilient SOP. We talked about that growing from $1.6 billion this year to $1.8 billion next year or 
in 2024. And that's consistent across the range. And then our transactional business lines are clearly the ones 
that will move up towards the bottom end or the high end of the range depending on when the recovery begins. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Anthony Paolone 
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q 
Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then just in terms of – you talked about ending the year with 1 turn of leverage 
and sounds like incremental investment into REI and so forth and then obviously J&J. But just like how much of 
the benefit from all of the capital investments do you think you'll see in 2024 versus 2025 or in future periods? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
I'll primarily speak to J&J. We are expecting to get likely three quarters of the benefit of that acquisition in-year. 
And we talked about what the EBITDA we're expecting for J&J in our press release, about $65 million for the year. 
So safe to assume we'll get three quarters of that in-year. The remainder of the co-investments in REI will be 
weighted more towards 2025 and beyond as those funds get launched and our developments get monetized. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Anthony Paolone 
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC Q 
Okay, thank you.

Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Steve Sakwa 
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC Q 
Great, thanks. And I guess just on capital deployment, I realize with the stock may be shooting up a lot in the 
fourth quarter, that tempered your enthusiasm for share buybacks. You only did about $20 million in the quarter. 
Just where do share buybacks sort of fit in on the capital deployment in 2024 at least within your guidance? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
So what we've always talked about is a balance of M&A, our co-investments in REI and share buybacks. And 
we'll do buybacks to balance out the other two when we view our share price to be attractive. What we really saw 
in Q4 is that we were anticipating the announcement of our acquisition of J&J. That deal is delivering a return well 
above our cost of capital. It's more accretive than buybacks in our analysis. And so you're seeing a weight more 
towards M&A and I expect that to continue this year. Our M&A pipeline is building. We're seeing a greater ability 
to transact. Sellers are more willing to meet our value expectations. So where we sit right now, I expect the 
balance to be towards M&A this year. But of course, if that changes, we'll look to repurchase shares. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Steve Sakwa 
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC Q 
Okay. And I know you provided a bunch of guideposts certainly on the revenue side. I just wanted to make sure 
from a margin perspective, I just kind of understand how are you thinking about the SOP margin in Advisory? And 
is there any sort of baked in improvement to margin in the GWS business? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
So on the Advisory side, you should see improvement in our overall Advisory margin in 2024, probably about 100 
basis points. That's because of our cost reduction plans and obviously a recovery in our transactions business. In 
GWS, our margin should hover around the same level and increase slightly. The J&J acquisition is slightly 
accretive to our margins. But this is a business, as you know, that we don't expect to see a step function change 
in our margin over time. It will gradually increase as we continue to differentiate that business. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Steve Sakwa 
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC Q 
Great, thanks. That's it for me.

Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Your 
line is now live. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Jade Rahmani 
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. Q 
Thank you very much. There's considerable uncertainty in the multifamily market. Walker & Dunlop just said on its 
earnings call that the GSEs Fannie and Freddie expect flat volumes for 2024, which is surprising given how low 
volumes were in 2023. In addition, we are seeing pockets of credit issues in floating rate loans and then 
significant supply. So I wanted to ask if you could comment on your overall volume expectations within that

sector. And also as it relates to Trammell Crow, I think that around 30% of that business' projects are multifamily. 
Do you expect any issues bringing those to fruition and generating target returns? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Robert E. Sulentic 
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
Yeah. I'll comment, Jade, on the Trammell Crow Company circumstances and Emma can comment on the 
volumes, the financing volumes. We are taking on a steady stream of new land sites in Trammell Crow Company 
that we're underwriting at returns that we think, based on current cap rates, will be consistent with our historical 
returns in that business. This is one of the things that really doesn't show up in any of our headlines that makes us 
excited about future profitability. 
 
It is true that there's some pressure in the multifamily markets based on the development that's happened over 
the last couple of years and the cost of leverage versus where those deals – the yields those deals were 
developed at. We think that is going to be self-correcting over the next couple of years. New development volume 
is going to come down. We're still at barely above historic levels of vacancy, I think maybe 50 basis points above 
historic levels of about 550 basis points of vacancy versus 5% historically. We think that is going to correct. We 
think the circumstance in the single family home market with the cost of mortgages is going to drive people toward 
renting. 
 
And so we are quite bullish after we get through a little tough window here in the multifamily business of where 
that's going to go. We're bullish about what it means for Trammell Crow Company. We're bullish about what it 
means for our investment management business. And we think that the volumes in our services business will be 
good over time. But we are going to go through, as you commented from the Walker & Dunlop call, there will be a 
window here where it's a little more difficult. That's fully contemplated, by the way, in the numbers that Emma 
gave you about our expectations for 2024. Emma, you want to add to that? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
And then on the GSEs. We have embedded in our forecast pretty much [indiscernible] (00:24:13) being flat to 
slightly up this year. The sentiment that we're seeing from the agencies is that they will get closer to their caps this 
year. But we are being conservative in terms of what we're projecting for the year. So likely it's slightly more 
positive than what you heard on the Walker & Dunlop call. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Jade Rahmani 
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. Q 
On the office leasing side, you mentioned you think that the worst is over there and that 65% of the business is 
Class A. Can you give any more color around maybe some anecdotal evidence or perhaps survey evidence that 
gives you confidence around that? I do know you put out monthly and quarterly reports from research showing 
such things as tenants in market or requirements. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Robert E. Sulentic 
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
Well, it is the case that we think it has bottomed out. It obviously is below where – meaningfully below where it 
was. Occupancy is – square footage per person is below where it was, per employee is below where it was in 
2019. There is all kinds of anecdotal evidence around that issue. Some stubbornness about people coming back 
to the office. That's super clear. The other thing is there's just a clear amount of pressure from companies to get 
their people back into the office for all kinds of reasons.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 15-Feb-2024 
 
 
What we do know and I would say the anecdotal evidence in this area is not just evidence. It's an avalanche of 
evidence. Every company that you talk to – you can't talk to a corporate that would tell you that office building 
occupancy either in buildings they own or buildings they lease is not important to their business. It's important to 
all of them. It's important to us in our business. And so what you're seeing is that people are redoing their space, 
trying to make it a better environment for their employees, make their employees more efficient, more engaged. 
Class A buildings that create that opportunity are seeing in a number of markets record rents. Buildings that aren't 
good are struggling and they're going to continue to struggle. 
 
So we look at that circumstance and we say there's pressure on both sides. But we think it's kind of stabilized. We 
think it'll be a very big asset class going forward, bigger than the headlines might suggest because people tend to 
like negative news. And in the real estate services business as opposed to the real estate owning businesses and 
we're in both of them, it's going to be a very large opportunity for CBRE. And you saw that with the Brookfield 
situation that we announced. You see that with the growth in our outsourcing business. You've seen it come 
through in our leasing numbers. So I think that you're going to see the future be better than the current 
circumstance has been for a variety of reasons. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Jade Rahmani 
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. Q 
Wanted to also, if I may, ask about infrastructure. The J&J acquisition deepens relationships with the Department 
of Defense in particular, it seems. And also we are seeing robust capital flows across the infrastructure space 
particularly in digital, data centers. Wanted to ask if you could comment if that's a strategic target, perhaps an 
area for M&A or co-investment on the Trammell Crow side. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Robert E. Sulentic 
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
Well, Jade, you're talking about the blurred lines between real estate and infrastructure in some regard. And in 
those areas, data centers and so forth, we do have some meaningful exposure. The places where we have kind 
of traditionally defined infrastructure exposure are with the Turner & Townsend business where they provide a lot 
of program and project and cost consultancy services to infrastructure type projects. And they are really well-
positioned for the future in that regard. 
 
We have an infrastructure investment management business that we would like to scale over time. And then in 
Trammell Crow Company, we do a variety of development. There are some things we're working on that are quite 
large between Trammell Crow Company and Turner & Townsend that would be in the infrastructure category. So 
we believe over time, we'll evolve to a place where we will do more work and invest more in infrastructure. But 
real estate is our core business for the time being.

Hey, thank you. Really nice job here and congrats on the J&J deal. With J&J likely to close here in the coming 
months, I just wanted to ask kind of what your appetite is for pursuing other large acquisitions. I know you guys 
are kind of looking at at least a few larger deals. So just curious if you have any commentary on what your 
appetite is, if you're still pursuing or looking at some larger acquisitions.

Robert E. Sulentic 
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
M&A work is a fundamental foundational element of what CBRE is about. We are committed across all of our 
lines of business to be a grower. We have built within our market-facing businesses capability to identify M&A 
opportunities in all of our businesses. We clearly have some places we're more interested in at any given point in 
time typically because they're secularly favored or because we have more of a right to win. But it is fundamental. 
And so if you look across our business, our people are in the market identifying opportunities at all times. 
 
We have built up our M&A capability in the center, our corporate development capability to the point where we 
think it's quite unique within our sector and is relatively strong against the broader base of companies out there 
outside our sectors or outside our sector. We have a strong balance sheet and a willingness to use that balance 
sheet to do M&A. So you should expect us to continue to build the business through M&A. We aren't going to do 
deals that we don't think are smart either financially or because they're hard to integrate or too hard to integrate. 
 
And it wasn't hard to watch us in the past year and say that maybe listening from quarter to quarter, there was 
more going on than you were seeing when you saw the J&J deal at the end. There will be other things, but we 
won't force M&A. We'll do M&A where we think we can grow our business the way we want to grow it into areas 
with secular tailwind, into areas where we have the right to win. And as Emma has said, it will likely be, over the 
long term, our number one use of capital.

Stephen Sheldon 
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC Q 
Got it, thanks. And then just in capital markets, just as you think about the last few months, how did activity 
progress through the fourth quarter into early January? I'm just curious whether you've seen fits and starts of 
activity based upon what's happening with interest rates and just generally how dependent do you think any 
capital markets improvement in 2024 and I guess into 2025 will be on the overall trend in interest rates. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
Yeah. So let's start with what we've been seeing over the past, through 2023 and through the end of the year. 
And we did see a significant deceleration in the decline, especially getting into Q4. So through the third quarter, 
we were looking at 40% declines up to that point. And then in the fourth quarter, we were down to below 20% 
decline. And what was notable about Q4 was that we actually saw a significant deceleration in December. So 
October-November, a greater decline than December which was in the single digit decline territory. So pulling that 
into 2024, we are not expecting a material uplift in capital markets activity. But we do expect it to grow at a mid-
single digit rate globally. If the recovery picks up faster than we're expecting, if rates come down further than the 
market is expecting; then there could be upside from there. But our base case scenario is that there won't be a 
significant uplift.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 15-Feb-2024 
 
Michael A. Griffin 
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Q 
Great, thanks. Just maybe going back to the guidance for a minute and appreciate you guys including it this year. 
I'm just curious if you can kind of quantify and give us a sense of if there are any cost savings initiatives factored 
into your outlook. I want to kind of get a sense of how much of this kind of growth is organic versus cost cutting. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
So there are cost savings embedded in our outlook. And where you will see the majority of it is within our Advisory 
business. I talked about earlier about 100 basis points of margin expansion in Advisory. We talked about $150 
million of run rate cost savings on our Q3 call that we're going to go after this year. We have identified 
opportunities to reduce $150 million of run rate cost. You'll see about half of that in-year and most of that will be in 
the Advisory segment. A piece to note about that is those cost savings are largely offsetting our bonuses, 
resetting in our discretionary compensation and our profit share is resetting to levels that are in line with our 
positive financial performance for the year. But it isn't embedded in the numbers that you're seeing. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Michael A. Griffin 
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Q 
Got you. That's helpful. Then maybe on the REI segment, I was curious if you could give us some insights into 
how development costs have been trending and where return hurdles and IRR is currently in the space. What 
would get you more interested in starting projects? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Robert E. Sulentic 
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
Well, I'm going to start with costs. That is starting to come under control. We had challenges. Everybody that was 
a developer here in the United States and around the world had challenges with costs the last few years. Now 
that was all typically rescued by accelerating rental rates and declining cap rates. And we think all of that has 
stabilized. Cap rates have gone up, rental rate growth has slowed. But cost growth has also come under control. 
So that's all come back into balance. 
 
We are underwriting projects now at spreads between current cap rates and yields on projects that should deliver 
profitability consistent with what has been delivered in that business historically. And I mentioned this earlier and 
I'll mention it again. Within that business over the last year, we've secured a good volume of development sites 
not at steal prices. But what's happened is sites that were otherwise not available have become available. 
 
And because many, many people are on the sidelines, many developers are on the sidelines and we have the 
CBRE parent company balance sheet available to us; we've been able to secure a good number of development 
opportunities with really good spreads between current cap rates and yields on the projects. So with that in the 
future, we think we're well positioned for that business. And in Emma's comments, you might have noticed that 
she said we've got hundreds of millions of dollars of profits captured in that in-process and pipeline portfolio 
development deals. We're quite excited about that. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Michael A. Griffin 
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Q 
Great. That's it for me. Thanks for the time.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 15-Feb-2024 
 
Operator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is now live. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Alex Kramm 
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC Q 
Yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. I may be nitpicky here a little bit, but can you just talk about your 2025 
commentary from this morning? I think a quarter ago you were still talking about achieving records. Now I think 
you're just hoping to get back to peak. So not sure if it's the environment that's changed or if you just think your, I 
guess, outlook incorporates a more conservative recovery in general. So maybe just compare and contrast how 
we should be thinking about your long-term outlook as you go into 2025. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
So I want to be clear that we have strong visibility into returning to our peak level of EPS in 2025. And that 
confidence has not declined since last quarter. It's at least equal to and potentially slightly above, especially if we 
achieve our expectations for 2024. And I can simply break down the components of how we'll get there between 
our resilient SOP and our transactional SOP. 
 
Within our resilient lines of business, like I said before, we expect $1.8 billion of SOP this year. That should 
continue to grow at at least a 10% rate next year. And we have a high level of confidence in delivering that 
outcome. And then on the transactional side, we do not need our transactional SOP to return anywhere near to 
peak levels of earnings like we did in 2022. And they don't even need to return to our level of transactional SOP in 
2019. So hopefully, that puts some perspective on our ability to achieve that outcome. The main risk is that the 
recovery would get delayed this year. And it would make that hurdle on the transactional side slightly higher next 
year. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Alex Kramm 
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC Q 
All right. Fair enough. And then just maybe a quick follow-up on the cost base. Obviously, you got the cost 
program in place. Since you've done a lot over the last few years, can you maybe just remind us where you think 
incrementals are on the transactional side now and break it out maybe between capital markets and leasing as 
we head to potentially [ph] another (00:39:15) recovery here? 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Emma E. Giamartino 
Chief Financial Officer, CBRE Group, Inc. A 
So overall, on our transactional business, our incremental margins are in the low to mid-30s. This is both across 
capital markets and leasing. And to put some more context around that, a 5% change in leasing results in a 3% 
delta in EPS. And on the sales side, a 5% change in our in-sales would be a 2% change in EPS. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  

Alex Kramm 
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC Q 
Excellent, thanks. 
 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  
 

Operator: Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back 
over to management for any further or closing comments.
