United Airlines Announces First-Quarter 2024 Financial Results; 
Exceeds Revenue and EPS Expectations 

 
 

First-quarter diluted loss per share of $0.38; first-quarter adjusted diluted loss per share1 of $0.15 - ahead of 
expectations 

 
Updates fleet plan - allowing for a more consistent delivery schedule of approximately 100 narrowbody aircraft 

yearly 2025 through 2027 
 

Achieved second-best first quarter on-time departure performance2 in the company's history 
 

 

CHICAGO, April 16, 2024 – United Airlines (UAL) today reported first-quarter 2024 financial results. The 

company had a pre-tax loss of $164 million, a $92 million improvement over the same quarter last year; adjusted 

pre-tax loss1 of $79 million, a $187 million improvement on an adjusted basis over the same quarter last year. 

These earnings reflect the approximately $200 million impact from the Boeing 737 MAX 9 grounding, without 

which the company would have reported a quarterly profit. In the quarter, the company generated $2.8 billion 

operating cash flow and free cash flow1 of $1.5 billion. The company continues to expect full-year 2024 adjusted 

diluted earnings per share3 of $9 to $11. 

United delivered strong financial and operational performance in the quarter. The demand environment 

remained strong with a double-digit percentage increase in business demand quarter over quarter, as compared to 

pre-pandemic. Additionally, the company was able to take advantage of a number of opportunities to adjust 

domestic capacity which drove meaningful improvements in first quarter profitability. Atlantic and Domestic 

markets both saw large passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) increases year over year, with 11% and 

6% growth respectively. 

“I want to thank the United team for working so hard this quarter to deliver strong operational metrics for 

our customers and sharpen our focus on safety, while producing excellent financial results for our shareholders,” 

said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby. "We’ve adjusted our fleet plan to better reflect the reality of what the 

manufacturers are able to deliver. And, we’ll use those planes to capitalize on an opportunity that only United has:

profitably grow our mid-continent hubs and expand our highly profitable international network from our best in 

the industry coastal hubs." 

Fleet Update 

United has made several adjustments to its long-term fleet strategy based on future needs of the airline 

and manufacturers production and delivery timelines that are expected to smooth out and moderate the 

company's aircraft delivery schedule in the coming years including: 

• Converted a portion of Boeing MAX 10 aircraft orders to Boeing MAX 9 from 2025 through 2027; 

maintained the right to convert more Boeing MAX 10 into MAX 8 or MAX 9 as needed.  

• Have agreed to letters of intent with two lessors to lease 35 new Airbus A321neos with CFM engines 

expected in 2026 and 2027. 

• Due to manufacturing and certification delays from prior years, by the end of 2023, the airline’s 

contractual aircraft commitments for 2024 had increased to 183 narrowbody aircraft. At the beginning of 

2024, these delays were anticipated to continue and the company expected 101 narrowbody deliveries. 

Following the 737 MAX 9 grounding and the FAA’s announced significant production capacity constraints 

on Boeing, the company now anticipates 61 narrowbody aircraft and 5 widebody aircraft to be delivered in 

2024. 

 

In the short run, the company expects a small number of aircraft previously scheduled to enter into service in the 

second quarter to be pushed into the third quarter, which is expected to have minimal impact on the company's 

capacity plans.

discuss the possible future effects of known trends or uncertainties, or that indicate that the future effects of known trends or 
uncertainties cannot be predicted, guaranteed or assured. All forward-looking statements in this release are based upon 
information available to us on the date of this release. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-
looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise, except as 
required by applicable law or regulation. 
 
Our actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements due to numerous factors including, without 
limitation, the following: execution risks associated with our strategic operating plan; changes in our fleet and network 
strategy or other factors outside our control resulting in less economic aircraft orders, costs related to modification or 
termination of aircraft orders or entry into aircraft orders on less favorable terms, as well as any inability to accept or integrate 
new aircraft into our fleet as planned, including as a result of any mandatory groundings of aircraft; any failure to effectively 
manage, and receive anticipated benefits and returns from, acquisitions, divestitures, investments, joint ventures and other 
portfolio actions, or related exposures to unknown liabilities or other issues or underperformance as compared to our 
expectations; adverse publicity, harm to our brand, reduced travel demand, potential tort liability and operational restrictions 
as a result of an accident, catastrophe or incident involving us, our regional carriers, our codeshare partners or another airline; 
the highly competitive nature of the global airline industry and susceptibility of the industry to price discounting and changes 
in capacity, including as a result of alliances, joint business arrangements or other consolidations; our reliance on a limited 
number of suppliers to source a majority of our aircraft, engines and certain parts, and the impact of any failure to obtain 
timely deliveries, additional equipment or support from any of these suppliers; disruptions to our regional network and United 
Express flights provided by third-party regional carriers; unfavorable economic and political conditions in the United States 
and globally; reliance on third-party service providers and the impact of any significant failure of these parties to perform as 
expected, or interruptions in our relationships with these providers or their provision of services; extended interruptions or 
disruptions in service at major airports where we operate and space, facility and infrastructure constraints at our hubs or 
other airports; geopolitical conflict, terrorist attacks or security events (including the continuation of the suspension of our 
overflying in Russian airspace as a result of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict and an escalation of the broader economic 
consequences of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict and the Israeli-Hamas military conflict beyond their current scope); any 
damage to our reputation or brand image; our reliance on technology and automated systems to operate our business and the 
impact of any significant failure or disruption of, or failure to effectively integrate and implement, these technologies or 
systems; increasing privacy, data security and cybersecurity obligations or a significant data breach; increased use of social 
media platforms by us, our employees and others; the impacts of union disputes, employee strikes or slowdowns, and other 
labor-related disruptions or regulatory compliance costs on our operations; any failure to attract, train or retain skilled 
personnel, including our senior management team or other key employees; the monetary and operational costs of compliance 
with extensive government regulation of the airline industry; current or future litigation and regulatory actions, or failure to 
comply with the terms of any settlement, order or agreement relating to these actions; costs, liabilities and risks associated 
with environmental regulation and climate change, and any failure to achieve or demonstrate progress towards our climate 
goals; high and/or volatile fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel (including as a result of the Russia-
Ukraine military conflict); the impacts of our significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations and the impacts of 
insufficient liquidity on our financial condition and business; failure to comply with financial and other covenants governing 
our debt, including our MileagePlus® financing agreements; limitations on our ability to use our net operating loss 
carryforwards and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes; our failure 
to realize the full value of our intangible assets or our long-lived assets, causing us to record impairments; fluctuations in the 
price of our common stock; the impacts of seasonality, weather events, infrastructure and other factors associated with the 
airline industry; increases in insurance costs or inadequate insurance coverage and other risks and uncertainties set forth in

Non-GAAP Financial Information: 
In discussing financial results and guidance, the company refers to financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). The non-GAAP financial measures are provided as supplemental 
information to the financial measures presented in this press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with 
GAAP and are presented because management believes that they supplement or enhance management's, analysts' and 
investors' overall understanding of the company's underlying financial performance and trends and facilitate comparisons 
among current, past and future periods. Non-GAAP financial measures such as CASM-ex (which excludes the impact of fuel 
expense, profit sharing, special charges and third-party expenses), adjusted pre-tax margin (which is calculated as pre-tax 
margin excluding operating and nonoperating special charges, unrealized (gains) losses on investments, net and debt 
extinguishment and modification fees), adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted net income 
typically have exclusions or adjustments that include one or more of the following characteristics, such as being highly

variable, difficult to project, unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of past or future 
operating results. These items are excluded because the company believes they neither relate to the ordinary course of the 
company's business nor reflect the company's underlying business performance. 
 
Because the non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered 
superior to and are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP financial measures 
presented in the press release and may not be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other 
companies due to possible differences in method and in the items being adjusted. We encourage investors to review our 
financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 
 
Please refer to the tables accompanying this release for a description of the non-GAAP adjustments and reconciliations of the 
historical non-GAAP financial measures used to the most comparable GAAP financial measure and related disclosures.

1 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

UAL evaluates its financial performance utilizing various accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and 
non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (adjusted EBITDA), adjusted 
EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA excluding aircraft rent (adjusted EBITDAR), adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted operating margin, 
adjusted pre-tax income (loss), adjusted pre-tax margin, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share, CASM-ex, 
adjusted capital expenditures, adjusted total debt, adjusted net debt, free cash flow, and free cash flow, net of financings, among others. The 
non-GAAP financial measures are provided as supplemental information to the financial measures presented in this press release that are 
calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and are presented because management believes that they supplement or enhance 
management's, analysts' and investors' overall understanding of the company's underlying financial performance and trends and facilitate 
comparisons among current, past and future periods.  
Because the non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered superior to and are not 
intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP financial measures presented in the press release and may not 
be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the 
items being adjusted. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on 
any single financial measure. 

The company does not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking measures where the company believes such a reconciliation would imply a 
degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors and is unable to reasonably predict certain items contained in the GAAP 
measures without unreasonable efforts. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have 
not yet occurred and are out of the company's control or cannot be reasonably predicted. For the same reasons, the company is unable to 
address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most 
directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures. See "Cautionary 
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" above. The information below provides an explanation of certain adjustments reflected in 
the non-GAAP financial measures and shows a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures reported in this press release to the most 
directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Within the financial tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of 
rounded numbers. Percentages and earnings per share amounts presented are calculated from the underlying amounts. 

CASM: CASM is a common metric used in the airline industry to measure an airline's cost structure and efficiency. UAL reports CASM 
excluding special charges, third-party business expenses, fuel expense, and profit sharing. UAL believes that adjusting for special charges is 
useful to investors because those items are not indicative of UAL's ongoing performance. UAL also believes that excluding third-party business 
expenses, such as maintenance, flight academy, ground handling and catering services for third parties, provides more meaningful disclosure 
because these expenses are not directly related to UAL's core business. UAL also believes that excluding fuel expense from certain measures 
is useful to investors because it provides an additional measure of management's performance excluding the effects of a significant cost item 
over which management has limited influence. UAL excludes profit sharing because it believes that this exclusion allows investors to better 
understand and analyze UAL's operating cost performance and provides a more meaningful comparison of our core operating costs to the 
airline industry. 

Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDAR: UAL also reports EBITDA and EBITDAR excluding special charges, nonoperating unrealized (gains) losses on 
investments, net and nonoperating debt extinguishment and modification fees. UAL believes that adjusting for these items is useful to 
investors because they are not indicative of UAL's ongoing performance.  
Adjusted Capital Expenditures and Free Cash Flow: UAL believes that adjusting capital expenditures for assets acquired through the issuance 
of debt, finance leases and other financial liabilities is useful to investors in order to appropriately reflect the total amounts spent on capital 
expenditures. UAL also believes that adjusting net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for capital expenditures, net of flight 
equipment purchase deposit returns, adjusted capital expenditures, and aircraft operating lease additions is useful to allow investors to 
evaluate the company's ability to generate cash that is available for debt service or general corporate initiatives. 
Adjusted Total Debt and Adjusted Net Debt: Adjusted total debt is a non-GAAP financial measure that includes current and long-term debt, 
operating lease obligations and finance lease obligations, current and noncurrent other financial liabilities and noncurrent pension and 
postretirement obligations. Adjusted net debt is adjusted total debt minus cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. UAL provides 
adjusted total debt and adjusted net debt because we believe these measures provide useful supplemental information for assessing the 
company's debt and debt-like obligation profile.
