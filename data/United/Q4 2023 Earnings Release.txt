United	Airlines	Announces	Full-Year	and	Fourth-Quarter	2023	
Financial	Results

Full-year	diluted	earnings	per	share	of	$7.89;	full-year	adjusted	diluted	earnings	per	share1	of	$10.05

Fourth	quarter	diluted	earnings	per	share	of	$1.81,	adjusted	diluted	earnings	per	share1	of	$2.00,	ahead	of	
expectations

Delivered	best	quarterly	on-time	arrival	performance	in	company	history2

Newark	operations	improved	substantially	with	the	best	4th	quarter	ever	for	on-time	performance

CHICAGO,	Jan.	22,	2024	–	United	Airlines	(UAL)	today	reported	fourth-quarter	and	full-year	2023	financial	

results.	The	company	delivered	full-year	diluted	earnings	per	share	of	$7.89	and	adjusted	full-year	diluted	earnings	

per	share1	of	$10.05,	achieving	its	initial	full-year	target	of	$10	-	$12	set	at	the	beginning	of	2023.	

United’s	diversified	revenue	strategy	proved,	once	again,	to	be	a	critical,	differentiated,	competitive	

advantage.	United’s	premium	cabin	saw	an	increase	in	revenue	of	16%	for	the	quarter	year-over-year,	while	its	

Basic	Economy	offering	again	saw	a	substantial	revenue	increase	of	20%	for	the	quarter	year-over-year.

	United	also	benefited	from	cost	convergence	across	the	industry.	This	cost	convergence	resulted	in	a	

stronger	relationship	between	United’s	unit	costs	and	unit	revenue	performance.	Combined	with	durable	demand	

for	travel	and	an	increasing	preference	for	United’s	reliable	operational	performance	and	premium	offerings,	the	

company	delivered	on	its	initial	full	year	2023	earnings	per	share	guidance	despite	a	wide	range	of	headwinds.

"Our	plans	really	came	together	in	2023,	and	I	want	to	thank	the	United	team	for	all	of	the	hard	work	it	

took	to	get	us	there,”	said	United	Airlines	CEO	Scott	Kirby.	“Despite	unpredictable	headwinds,	we	delivered	on	our	

ambitious	EPS	target	that	few	thought	possible	–	and	set	new	operational	records	for	our	customers,"	said	United	

Airlines	CEO	Scott	Kirby.	“Looking	ahead,	we	expect	these	trends	to	continue	and	United	is	incredibly	well	

positioned	to	capitalize	on	them	and	to	deliver	on	our	short	and	long-term	financial	targets."

Non-GAAP	Financial	Information:
In	discussing	financial	results	and	guidance,	the	company	refers	to	financial	measures	that	are	not	in	accordance	with	U.S.	
Generally	Accepted	Accounting	Principles	(“GAAP”).	The	non-GAAP	financial	measures	are	provided	as	supplemental	
information	to	the	financial	measures	presented	in	this	press	release	that	are	calculated	and	presented	in	accordance	with	
GAAP	and	are	presented	because	management	believes	that	they	supplement	or	enhance	management's,	analysts'	and	
investors'	overall	understanding	of	the	company's	underlying	financial	performance	and	trends	and	facilitate	comparisons	
among	current,	past	and	future	periods.	Non-GAAP	financial	measures	such	as	CASM-ex	(which	excludes	the	impact	of	fuel	
expense,	profit	sharing,	special	charges	and	third-party	expenses),	adjusted	pre-tax	margin	(which	is	calculated	as	pre-tax

variable,	difficult	to	project,	unusual	in	nature,	significant	to	the	results	of	a	particular	period	or	not	indicative	of	past	or

the	company's	business	nor	reflect	the	company's	underlying	business	performance.

superior	to	and	are	not	intended	to	be	considered	in	isolation	or	as	a	substitute	for	the	related	GAAP	financial	measures	
presented	in	the	press	release	and	may	not	be	the	same	as	or	comparable	to	similarly	titled	measures	presented	by	other	
companies	due	to	possible	differences	in	method	and	in	the	items	being	adjusted.	We	encourage	investors	to	review	our	
financial	statements	and	publicly-filed	reports	in	their	entirety	and	not	to	rely	on	any	single	financial	measure.

UAL	evaluates	its	financial	performance	utilizing	various	accounting	principles	generally	accepted	in	the	United	States	of	America	(GAAP)	and	
non-GAAP	financial	measures,	including	adjusted	earnings	before	interest,	taxes,	depreciation	and	amortization	(adjusted	EBITDA),	adjusted	
EBITDA	margin,	adjusted	EBITDA	excluding	aircraft	rent	(adjusted	EBITDAR),	adjusted	operating	income	(loss),	adjusted	operating	margin,	
adjusted	pre-tax	income	(loss),	adjusted	pre-tax	margin,	adjusted	net	income	(loss),	adjusted	diluted	earnings	(loss)	per	share,	CASM-ex,	
adjusted	capital	expenditures,	adjusted	total	debt,	adjusted	net	debt,	free	cash	flow,	and	free	cash	flow,	net	of	financings,	among	others.	The	
non-GAAP	financial	measures	are	provided	as	supplemental	information	to	the	financial	measures	presented	in	this	press	release	that	are	
calculated	and	presented	in	accordance	with	GAAP	and	are	presented	because	management	believes	that	they	supplement	or	enhance	
management's,	analysts'	and	investors'	overall	understanding	of	the	company's	underlying	financial	performance	and	trends	and	facilitate	
comparisons	among	current,	past	and	future	periods.	
Because	the	non-GAAP	financial	measures	are	not	calculated	in	accordance	with	GAAP,	they	should	not	be	considered	superior	to	and	are	not	
intended	to	be	considered	in	isolation	or	as	a	substitute	for	the	related	GAAP	financial	measures	presented	in	the	press	release	and	may	not	
be	the	same	as	or	comparable	to	similarly	titled	measures	presented	by	other	companies	due	to	possible	differences	in	method	and	in	the	
items	being	adjusted.	We	encourage	investors	to	review	our	financial	statements	and	publicly-filed	reports	in	their	entirety	and	not	to	rely	on	
any	single	financial	measure.
The	company	does	not	provide	a	reconciliation	of	forward-looking	measures	where	the	company	believes	such	a	reconciliation	would	imply	a	
degree	of	precision	and	certainty	that	could	be	confusing	to	investors	and	is	unable	to	reasonably	predict	certain	items	contained	in	the	
GAAP	measures	without	unreasonable	efforts.	This	is	due	to	the	inherent	difficulty	of	forecasting	the	timing	or	amount	of	various	items	that	
have	not	yet	occurred	and	are	out	of	the	company's	control	or	cannot	be	reasonably	predicted.	For	the	same	reasons,	the	company	is	unable	
to	address	the	probable	significance	of	the	unavailable	information.	Forward-looking	non-GAAP	financial	measures	provided	without	the	
most	directly	comparable	GAAP	financial	measures	may	vary	materially	from	the	corresponding	GAAP	financial	measures.	See	"Cautionary	
Statement	Regarding	Forward-Looking	Statements"	above.	The	information	below	provides	an	explanation	of	certain	adjustments	reflected	
in	the	non-GAAP	financial	measures	and	shows	a	reconciliation	of	non-GAAP	financial	measures	reported	in	this	press	release	to	the	most	
directly	comparable	GAAP	financial	measures.	Within	the	financial	tables	presented,	certain	columns	and	rows	may	not	add	due	to	the	use	of	
rounded	numbers.	Percentages	and	earnings	per	share	amounts	presented	are	calculated	from	the	underlying	amounts.
CASM:	CASM	is	a	common	metric	used	in	the	airline	industry	to	measure	an	airline's	cost	structure	and	efficiency.	UAL	reports	CASM	
excluding	special	charges,	third-party	business	expenses,	fuel	expense,	and	profit	sharing.	UAL	believes	that	adjusting	for	special	charges	is	
useful	to	investors	because	those	items	are	not	indicative	of	UAL's	ongoing	performance.	UAL	also	believes	that	excluding	third-party	
business	expenses,	such	as	maintenance,	flight	academy,	ground	handling	and	catering	services	for	third	parties,	provides	more	meaningful	
disclosure	because	these	expenses	are	not	directly	related	to	UAL's	core	business.	UAL	also	believes	that	excluding	fuel	expense	from	certain	
measures	is	useful	to	investors	because	it	provides	an	additional	measure	of	management's	performance	excluding	the	effects	of	a	significant	
cost	item	over	which	management	has	limited	influence.	UAL	excludes	profit	sharing	because	it	believes	that	this	exclusion	allows	investors	
to	better	understand	and	analyze	UAL's	operating	cost	performance	and	provides	a	more	meaningful	comparison	of	our	core	operating	costs	
to	the	airline	industry.
Adjusted	EBITDA	and	EBITDAR:	UAL	also	reports	EBITDA	and	EBITDAR	excluding	special	charges,	nonoperating	unrealized	(gains)	losses	on	
investments,	net	and	nonoperating	debt	extinguishment	and	modification	fees.	UAL	believes	that	adjusting	for	these	items	is	useful	to	
investors	because	they	are	not	indicative	of	UAL's	ongoing	performance.	
Adjusted	Capital	Expenditures	and	Free	Cash	Flow:	UAL	believes	that	adjusting	capital	expenditures	for	assets	acquired	through	the	issuance	
of	debt,	finance	leases	and	other	financial	liabilities	is	useful	to	investors	in	order	to	appropriately	reflect	the	total	amounts	spent	on	capital	
expenditures.	UAL	also	believes	that	adjusting	net	cash	provided	by	(used	in)	operating	activities	for	capital	expenditures,	net	of	flight	
equipment	purchase	deposit	returns,	adjusted	capital	expenditures,	and	aircraft	operating	lease	additions	is	useful	to	allow	investors	to	
evaluate	the	company's	ability	to	generate	cash	that	is	available	for	debt	service	or	general	corporate	initiatives.
Adjusted	Total	Debt	and	Adjusted	Net	Debt:	Adjusted	total	debt	is	a	non-GAAP	financial	measure	that	includes	current	and	long-term	debt,	
operating	lease	obligations	and	finance	lease	obligations,	current	and	noncurrent	other	financial	liabilities	and	noncurrent	pension	and	
postretirement	obligations.	Adjusted	net	debt	is	adjusted	total	debt	minus	cash,	cash	equivalents	and	short-term	investments.	UAL	provides	
adjusted	total	debt	and	adjusted	net	debt	because	we	believe	these	measures	provide	useful	supplemental	information	for	assessing	the	
company's	debt	and	debt-like	obligation	profile.
