United Airlines Announces Third-Quarter Financial Results: 
Revenue Beats Consensus on Solid Domestic - and               

Record-Breaking International Performance 

 
Company had record setting profits in both Atlantic and Pacific regions 

 
Pre-tax income increased 29% y-o-y; on an adjusted basis1 increased 37% 

 
Delivered strong operational performance, with September being best on-time performance of the year  

 
Increasingly powerful segmentation strategy proving to be a competitive advantage 

 
 

CHICAGO, Oct. 17, 2023 – United Airlines (UAL) today reported third-quarter 2023 financial results. The 

company reported quarterly pre-tax income of $1.5 billion, pre-tax margin of 10.3 % and diluted earnings per share 

of $3.42 and; on an adjusted1 basis, pre-tax income of $1.6 billion, pre-tax margin of 10.8% and diluted earnings 

per share of $3.65. 

Total third-quarter top line revenue was up 12.5% year-over-year, a record revenue quarter and near the 

high end of guidance. United experienced a strong and steady domestic demand environment in the quarter, with 

9% revenue growth year-over-year, outpacing second quarter results. The company saw strength in close-in 

bookings in August and September with both months well ahead of year-over-year demand. 

In the international space, profits were at record highs in both the Atlantic and Pacific regions. Revenue in 

the Atlantic region was up 15% versus the same quarter in 2022, and 70% versus the same quarter in 2019. Pacific 

revenue exceeded third-quarter 2019 levels despite capacity remaining 24% below third-quarter 2019. Domestic 

revenues in the quarter were second highest all-time and the domestic system remains solidly profitable. 

The company has built a winning strategy around giving customers choice when it comes to the level of 

service they want. Demand for premium products remains high, with great success in the premium economy cabin 

where revenue has outpaced capacity growth since its introduction in 2019. In total, revenue from premium 

products was up 20% year-over-year in the quarter and accounts for more than half of all passenger revenue. Basic

Economy has also provided another popular option for customers and has been a great competitive offering with 

revenue for that product in the quarter up 50% year-over-year. 

United continues to see the benefits of having an award winning airline loyalty program. The third quarter 

showed a continued multi-year new MileagePlus® member trend, setting a record for third quarter enrollments 

and nearly doubling the number of new members versus the third quarter just five years ago. Spending across the 

U.S. card portfolio year-to-date is up double-digits over the first three quarters of 2022 and this third quarter saw 

more miles redeemed across the program than any third quarter in history for award travel.  

"Thank you to our extraordinary United team who delivered a record-setting operational performance for 

our customers in August and September," said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby. “Our strategy to diversify our 

revenue streams, capitalize on growth opportunities and constantly innovate to enhance our products for our 

customers is paying off. Our United Next strategy is working and we remain on track to hit our financial targets."

information available to us on the date of this release. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-
looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise, except as 
required by applicable law or regulation. 
 
Our actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements due to numerous factors including, without 
limitation, the following: execution risks associated with our strategic operating plan; changes in our network strategy or other 
factors outside our control resulting in less economic aircraft orders, costs related to modification or termination of aircraft 
orders or entry into less favorable aircraft orders, as well as any inability to accept or integrate new aircraft into our fleet as 
planned; any failure to effectively manage, and receive anticipated benefits and returns from, acquisitions, divestitures, 
investments, joint ventures and other portfolio actions, or related exposures to unknown liabilities or other issues or 
underperformance as compared to our expectations; the adverse impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic on our 
business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity; adverse publicity, harm to our brand, reduced travel demand, 
potential tort liability and voluntary or mandatory operational restrictions as a result of an accident, catastrophe or incident 
involving us, our regional carriers, our codeshare partners or another airline; the highly competitive nature of the global airline 
industry and susceptibility of the industry to price discounting and changes in capacity, including as a result of alliances, joint 
business arrangements or other consolidations; our reliance on a limited number of suppliers to source a majority of our 
aircraft and certain parts, and the impact of any failure to obtain timely deliveries, additional equipment or support from any 
of these suppliers; disruptions to our regional network and United Express flights provided by third-party regional carriers; 
unfavorable economic and political conditions in the United States and globally (including inflationary pressures); reliance on 
third-party service providers and the impact of any significant failure of these parties to perform as expected, or interruptions 
in our relationships with these providers or their provision of services; extended interruptions or disruptions in service at 
major airports where we operate and space, facility and infrastructure constrains at our hubs or other airports; geopolitical 
conflict, terrorist attacks or security events (including the continuation of the suspension of our overflying in Russian airspace 
as a result of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict and to Tel Aviv as a result of the Israeli-Palestinian military conflict and an 
escalation of the broader economic consequences of the conflicts beyond their current scope); any damage to our reputation 
or brand image; our reliance on technology and automated systems to operate our business and the impact of any significant 
failure or disruption of, or failure to effectively integrate and implement, the technology or systems; increasing privacy and 
data security obligations or a significant data breach; increased use of social media platforms by us, our employees and others; 
the impacts of union disputes, employee strikes or slowdowns, and other labor-related disruptions or regulatory compliance 
costs on our operations; any failure to attract, train or retain skilled personnel, including our senior management team or 
other key employees; the monetary and operational costs of compliance with extensive government regulation of the airline 
industry; current or future litigation and regulatory actions, or failure to comply with the terms of any settlement, order or 
arrangement relating to these actions; costs, liabilities and risks associated with environmental regulation and climate change, 
including our climate goals; high and/or volatile fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel (including as 
a result of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict); the impacts of our significant amount of financial leverage from fixed 
obligations and the impacts of insufficient liquidity on our financial condition and business; failure to comply with financial 
and other covenants governing our debt, including our MileagePlus® financing agreements; the impacts of the phaseout of 
the London interbank offer rate; limitations on our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax 
attributes to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes; our failure to realize the full value of our 
intangible assets or our long-lived assets, causing us to record impairments; fluctuations in the price of our common stock; the 
impacts of seasonality, weather events, infrastructure and other factors associated with the airline industry; increases in 
insurance costs or inadequate insurance coverage and other risks and uncertainties set forth in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors,

In discussing financial results and guidance, the company refers to financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures are provided as supplemental 
information to the financial measures presented in this press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with 
GAAP and are presented because management believes that they supplement or enhance management's, analysts' and 
investors' overall understanding of the company's underlying financial performance and trends and facilitate comparisons 
among current, past and future periods. Non-GAAP financial measures such as CASM-ex (which excludes the impact of fuel 
expense, profit sharing, special charges and third-party expenses), adjusted pre-tax margin (which is calculated as pre-tax 
margin excluding operating and nonoperating special charges, unrealized (gains) losses on investments, net and debt 
extinguishment and modification fees), adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted net income 
typically have exclusions or adjustments that include one or more of the following characteristics, such as being highly 
variable, difficult to project, unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of past or future 
operating results. These items are excluded because the company believes they neither relate to the ordinary course of the 
company's business nor reflect the company's underlying business performance.

superior to and are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP financial measures 
presented in the press release and may not be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other 
companies due to possible differences in method and in the items being adjusted. We encourage investors to review our 
financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

United Airlines Announces Third-Quarter Financial Results  

UNITED AIRLINES HOLDINGS, INC. 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

UAL evaluates its financial performance utilizing various accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and 
non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (adjusted EBITDA), adjusted 
EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA excluding aircraft rent (adjusted EBITDAR), adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted operating margin, 
adjusted pre-tax income (loss), adjusted pre-tax margin, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share, CASM-ex, 
adjusted capital expenditures, adjusted net debt, free cash flow, and free cash flow, net of financings, among others. The non-GAAP financial 
measures are provided as supplemental information to the financial measures presented in this press release that are calculated and 
presented in accordance with GAAP and are presented because management believes that they supplement or enhance management's, 
analysts' and investors' overall understanding of the company's underlying financial performance and trends and facilitate comparisons 
among current, past and future periods.  

Because the non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered superior to and are not 
intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP financial measures presented in the press release and may not 
be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the 
items being adjusted. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on 
any single financial measure. 

The company does not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking measures where the company believes such a reconciliation would imply a 
degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors and is unable to reasonably predict certain items contained in the GAAP 
measures without unreasonable efforts. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have 
not yet occurred and are out of the company's control or cannot be reasonably predicted. For the same reasons, the company is unable to 
address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most 
directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures. See "Cautionary 
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" above. The information below provides an explanation of certain adjustments reflected in 
the non-GAAP financial measures and shows a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures reported in this press release to the most 
directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Within the financial tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of 
rounded numbers. Percentages and earnings per share amounts presented are calculated from the underlying amounts. 

CASM: CASM is a common metric used in the airline industry to measure an airline's cost structure and efficiency. UAL reports CASM 
excluding special charges, third-party business expenses, fuel expense, and profit sharing. UAL believes that adjusting for special charges is 
useful to investors because those items are not indicative of UAL's ongoing performance. UAL also believes that excluding third-party business 
expenses, such as maintenance, flight academy, ground handling and catering services for third parties, provides more meaningful disclosure 
because these expenses are not directly related to UAL's core business. UAL also believes that excluding fuel expense from certain measures 
is useful to investors because it provides an additional measure of management's performance excluding the effects of a significant cost item 
over which management has limited influence. UAL excludes profit sharing because it believes that this exclusion allows investors to better 
understand and analyze UAL's operating cost performance and provides a more meaningful comparison of our core operating costs to the 
airline industry. 

Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDAR: UAL also reports EBITDA and EBITDAR excluding special charges, nonoperating unrealized (gains) losses on 
investments, net, nonoperating debt extinguishment and modification fees and nonoperating special termination benefits. UAL believes that 
adjusting for these items is useful to investors because they are not indicative of UAL's ongoing performance.  
Adjusted Capital Expenditures and Free Cash Flow: UAL believes that adjusting capital expenditures for assets acquired through the issuance 
of debt, finance leases and other financial liabilities is useful to investors in order to appropriately reflect the total amounts spent on capital 
expenditures. UAL also believes that adjusting net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for capital expenditures, net of flight 
equipment purchase deposit returns, adjusted capital expenditures, and aircraft operating lease additions is useful to allow investors to 
evaluate the company's ability to generate cash that is available for debt service or general corporate initiatives. 
Adjusted Total Debt and Adjusted Net Debt: Adjusted total debt is a non-GAAP financial measure that includes current and long-term debt, 
operating lease obligations and finance lease obligations, current and noncurrent other financial liabilities and noncurrent pension and 
postretirement obligations. Adjusted net debt is adjusted total debt minus cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. UAL provides 
adjusted total debt and adjusted net debt because we believe these measures provide useful supplemental information for assessing the 
company's debt and debt-like obligation profile.
