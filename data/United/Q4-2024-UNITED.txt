CHICAGO, Jan. 21, 2025 – United Airlines (UAL) today reported full-year and fourth-quarter 2024 financial 

results. The company had full-year pre-tax earnings of $4.2 billion, with a pre-tax margin of 7.3%; adjusted pre-tax 

earnings1 of $4.6 billion, with an adjusted pre-tax margin1 of 8.1%. The company also achieved full-year diluted 

earnings per share of $9.45; adjusted diluted earnings per share1 of $10.61, at the better end of the 2024 guidance 

provided at the start of the year of $9.00 to $11.00.  

In 2024, United continued strong execution on its United Next plan. The company's investments have set 

United apart and customers continue to show more preference for the United brand with strong demand for all 

products: in the quarter premium revenue was up 10%, corporate revenue was up 7% and revenue from Basic 

Economy was up 20% year-over-year. Other revenue streams like loyalty and cargo had robust growth in the 

quarter with revenues up 12% and 30% year-over-year, respectively. Looking ahead to 2025 United sees strong 

demand trends in the first quarter with domestic RASM expected to turn solidly positive year-over-year, as well as 

continued improvement in international RASM.  

For the full year, the company operated the most flights and carried the most customers in its history. 

United finished first in on-time performance at all seven of its U.S. hubs as a result of significant investments in its 

people, airports and technology, resulting in year-over-year improvement in customer satisfaction. 

"United had a unique strategy coming out of COVID and our people have delivered for customers leading 

to a structurally and permanently changed industry," said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby. "2024 was a strong year 

across the board for United as we’ve become the leading global airline and we enter 2025 with demand trends 

continuing to accelerate which puts us on the path to double-digit pre-tax margins."

expectations; adverse publicity, increased regulatory scrutiny, harm to our brand, reduced travel demand, potential tort 
liability and operational restrictions as a result of an accident, catastrophe or incident involving us, our regional carriers, our 
codeshare partners or another airline; the highly competitive nature of the global airline industry and susceptibility of the 
industry to price discounting and changes in capacity, including as a result of alliances, joint business arrangements or other

the suspension of our overflying in Russian airspace as a result of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict and interruptions of our 
flying as a result of the military conflict in the Middle East, as well as any escalation of the broader economic consequences of 
these conflicts beyond their current scope); any damage to our reputation or brand image; our reliance on technology and

integrate and implement, these technologies or systems; increasing privacy, data security and cybersecurity obligations or a 
significant data breach; increased use of social media platforms by us, our employees and others; the impacts of union 
disputes, employee strikes or slowdowns, and other labor-related disruptions or regulatory compliance costs on our 
operations or financial performance; any failure to attract, train or retain skilled personnel, including our senior management 
team or other key employees; the monetary and operational costs of compliance with extensive government regulation of the 
airline industry; current or future litigation and regulatory actions, or failure to comply with the terms of any settlement, order 
or agreement relating to these actions; costs, liabilities and risks associated with environmental regulation and climate 
change, and any failure to achieve or demonstrate progress towards our climate goals; high and/or volatile fuel prices or 
significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel; the impacts of our significant amount of financial leverage from fixed 
obligations and the impacts of insufficient liquidity on our financial condition and business; failure to comply with financial

1 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

UAL evaluates its financial performance utilizing various accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and 
non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (adjusted EBITDA), adjusted 
EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA excluding aircraft rent (adjusted EBITDAR), adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income (loss), 
adjusted operating margin, adjusted pre-tax income (loss), adjusted pre-tax margin, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted diluted earnings 
(loss) per share, CASM-ex, adjusted capital expenditures, adjusted total debt, adjusted net debt, net leverage, free cash flow, and free cash 
flow, net of financings, among others. The non-GAAP financial measures are provided as supplemental information to the financial measures 
presented in this press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and are presented because management believes 
that they supplement or enhance management's, analysts' and investors' overall understanding of the company's underlying financial 
performance and trends and facilitate comparisons among current, past and future periods.  

Because the non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered superior to and are not 
intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP financial measures presented in the press release and may not 
be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the 
items being adjusted. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on 
any single financial measure. 

The company does not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking measures where the company believes such a reconciliation would imply a 
degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors and is unable to reasonably predict certain items contained in the GAAP 
measures without unreasonable efforts. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have 
not yet occurred and are out of the company's control or cannot be reasonably predicted. For the same reasons, the company is unable to 
address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most 
directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures. See "Cautionary 
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" above. The information below provides an explanation of certain adjustments reflected in 
the non-GAAP financial measures and shows a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures reported in this press release to the most 
directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Within the financial tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of 
rounded numbers. Percentages, ratios and earnings per share amounts presented are calculated from the underlying amounts. 

CASM: CASM is a common metric used in the airline industry to measure an airline's cost structure and efficiency. UAL reports CASM 
excluding special charges, third-party business expenses, fuel expense, and profit sharing. UAL believes that adjusting for special charges is 
useful to investors because those items are not indicative of UAL's ongoing performance. UAL also believes that excluding third-party business 
expenses, such as maintenance, flight academy, ground handling and catering services for third parties, provides more meaningful disclosure 
because these expenses are not directly related to UAL's core business. UAL also believes that excluding fuel expense from certain measures 
is useful to investors because it provides an additional measure of management's performance excluding the effects of a significant cost item 
over which management has limited influence. UAL excludes profit sharing because it believes that this exclusion allows investors to better 
understand and analyze UAL's operating cost performance and provides a more meaningful comparison of our core operating costs to the 
airline industry. 

Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDAR: UAL also reports EBITDA and EBITDAR excluding special charges, nonoperating unrealized (gains) losses on 
investments, net and nonoperating debt extinguishment and modification fees. UAL believes that adjusting for these items is useful to 
investors because they are not indicative of UAL's ongoing performance.  
Adjusted Capital Expenditures and Free Cash Flow: UAL believes that adjusting capital expenditures for assets acquired through the issuance 
of debt, finance leases and other financial liabilities is useful to investors in order to appropriately reflect the total amounts spent on capital 
expenditures. UAL also believes that adjusting net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for capital expenditures, net of flight 
equipment purchase deposit returns and adjusted capital expenditures is useful to allow investors to evaluate the company's ability to 
generate cash that is available for debt service or general corporate initiatives. 
Adjusted Total Debt and Adjusted Net Debt: Adjusted total debt is a non-GAAP financial measure that includes current and long-term debt, 
finance lease obligations and other financial liabilities, current and noncurrent operating lease obligations and noncurrent pension and 
postretirement obligations. Adjusted net debt is adjusted total debt minus cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. UAL provides 
adjusted total debt and adjusted net debt because we believe these measures provide useful supplemental information for assessing the 
company's debt and debt-like obligation profile.  
Net Leverage: Net leverage is a non-GAAP financial measure that is equal to adjusted net debt divided by trailing twelve month adjusted 
EBITDAR. UAL provides net leverage because we believe it provides useful supplemental information for assessing the company's debt level.
