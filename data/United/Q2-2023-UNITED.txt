United	Airlines	Announces	Second-Quarter	Financial	Results:	
Achieves	Record-Setting	Financial	Performance

In	addition	to	YOY	EPS	and	pre-tax	margin	improvement,	achieved	highest	quarterly	adjusted	EPS1	and	second-
quarter	adjusted	pre-tax	margin1	in	company	history

Expects	full-year	2023	adjusted	EPS2	to	now	be	$11-$12

Strengthened	balance	sheet	--	ahead	of	pace	to	reach	FY23	leverage	target

Record-setting	2Q	performance	is	clear	evidence	of	'United	Next'	success

CHICAGO,	July	19,	2023	–	United	Airlines	(UAL)	today	reported	second-quarter	2023	financial	results.	The	

company	reported	quarterly	earnings	per	share	of	$3.24	and	pre-tax	margin	of	9.8%.	The	company	set	records	on	

an	adjusted	basis1	with	earnings	per	share	of	$5.03	and	pre-tax	margin	of	15.3%.	The	strong	financial	performance	

has	accelerated	the	company's	efforts	to	restore	its	balance	sheet,	resulting	in	trailing	twelve	months	adjusted	net	

debt1	to	adjusted	EBITDAR1	of	2.4x,	back	to	2019	levels	and	ahead	of	its	full	year	2023	target	of	less	than	3x.	The	

momentum	from	the	second	quarter	is	expected	to	power	the	company	to	full	year	2023	adjusted	earnings	per	

share2	of	$11	to	$12,	up	versus	previous	guidance	of	$10	to	$12.	The	all-time	quarterly	highs	in	the	second	quarter	

and	the	bright	outlook	for	the	future	are	evidence	that	the	United	Next	strategy	to	upgauge	the	airline,	increase	

connectivity	at	its	mid-continent	hubs,	and	expand	its	industry	leading	global	network	is	working.

The	company's	second	quarter	performance	also	benefited	from	the	strength	in	its	network.	In	the	second	

quarter,	United's	domestic	margins	returned	to	2019	levels	while	international	margins	were	well	above	2019.	

United	continues	to	establish	its	position	as	the	United	States	flag	carrier,	with	a	27%	increase	in	capacity	

internationally	versus	the	same	quarter	last	year.	Looking	to	capitalize	on	demand	for	international	travel,	United	

announced	earlier	this	week	a	second	expansion	of	its	Pacific	flying	this	fall	with	new	flights	to	Manila,	Hong	Kong,	

Taipei	and	Tokyo	(Narita).	The	airline	is	expecting	to	maximize	the	success	of	its	international	business	with	the	

largest	widebody	aircraft	order	in	history	that	it	announced	with	Boeing	in	December	2022.

"The	United	team	persevered	through	an	unprecedented	series	of	events	at	the	end	of	last	month.	They	

are	the	best	in	the	business	and	we're	focused	on	the	important	changes	we	can	make,	especially	in	Newark,	to

2	Adjusted	diluted	earnings	per	share	is	a	measure	that	is	not	calculated	in	accordance	with	accounting	principles	generally	accepted	in	the	United	States	of	
America	("GAAP")	and	excludes	operating	and	non-operating	special	charges	and	unrealized	(gains)	losses	on	investments,	net.	We	are	not	providing	a	target	
for	or	a	reconciliation	to	diluted	earnings	per	share,	the	most	directly	comparable	GAAP	measure,	because	we	are	unable	to	predict	the	excluded	items	noted	
above	contained	in	the	GAAP	measure	without	unreasonable	efforts,	and	therefore	we	also	are	not	able	to	predict	the	probable	significance	of	such	items.

serve	our	customers	even	better,"	said	United	Airlines	CEO	Scott	Kirby.	"United's	financial	performance	in	the	

second	quarter	and	our	outlook	for	the	remainder	of	the	year	and	beyond	make	it	clear	that	United	Next	is	

working	and	is	the	right	strategy	at	the	right	time.	Our	focus	now	is	on	executing	that	strategy	well	–	because	we	

know	it	will	deliver	huge	benefits	for	our	customers,	our	employees	and	our	owners."

Non-GAAP	Financial	Information:
In	discussing	financial	results	and	guidance,	the	company	refers	to	financial	measures	that	are	not	in	accordance	with	U.S.	
Generally	Accepted	Accounting	Principles	(GAAP).	The	non-GAAP	financial	measures	are	provided	as	supplemental	
information	to	the	financial	measures	presented	in	this	press	release	that	are	calculated	and	presented	in	accordance	with	
GAAP	and	are	presented	because	management	believes	that	they	supplement	or	enhance	management's,	analysts'	and	
investors'	overall	understanding	of	the	company's	underlying	financial	performance	and	trends	and	facilitate	comparisons	
among	current,	past	and	future	periods.	Non-GAAP	financial	measures	such	as	adjusted	operating	margin	(which	excludes	
special	charges),	CASM-ex	(which	excludes	the	impact	of	fuel	expense,	profit	sharing,	special	charges	and	third-party	
expenses),	adjusted	pre-tax	margin	(which	is	calculated	as	pre-tax	margin	excluding	operating	and	nonoperating	special	
charges	and	unrealized	(gains)	losses	on	investments,	net)	and	adjusted	net	income	typically	have	exclusions	or	adjustments	
that	include	one	or	more	of	the	following	characteristics,	such	as	being	highly	variable,	difficult	to	project,	unusual	in	nature,	
significant	to	the	results	of	a	particular	period	or	not	indicative	of	past	or	future	operating	results.	These	items	are	excluded	
because	the	company	believes	they	neither	relate	to	the	ordinary	course	of	the	company's	business	nor	reflect	the	company's	
underlying	business	performance.

Because	the	non-GAAP	financial	measures	are	not	calculated	in	accordance	with	GAAP,	they	should	not	be	considered	
superior	to	and	are	not	intended	to	be	considered	in	isolation	or	as	a	substitute	for	the	related	GAAP	financial	measures

United	Airlines	Announces	Second-Quarter	Financial	Results:	Achieves	Record-Setting	Financial	Performance

UNITED	AIRLINES	HOLDINGS,	INC.

NON-GAAP	FINANCIAL	INFORMATION

UAL	evaluates	its	financial	performance	utilizing	various	accounting	principles	generally	accepted	in	the	United	States	of	America	(GAAP)	and	
non-GAAP	financial	measures,	including	adjusted	earnings	before	interest,	taxes,	depreciation	and	amortization	(adjusted	EBITDA),	adjusted	
EBITDA	margin,	adjusted	EBITDA	excluding	aircraft	rent	(adjusted	EBITDAR),	adjusted	operating	income	(loss),	adjusted	operating	margin,	
adjusted	pre-tax	income	(loss),	adjusted	pre-tax	margin,	adjusted	net	income	(loss),	adjusted	diluted	earnings	(loss)	per	share,	CASM-ex,	
adjusted	capital	expenditures,	free	cash	flow,	and	free	cash	flow,	net	of	financings,	among	others.	The	non-GAAP	financial	measures	are	
provided	as	supplemental	information	to	the	financial	measures	presented	in	this	press	release	that	are	calculated	and	presented	in	
accordance	with	GAAP	and	are	presented	because	management	believes	that	they	supplement	or	enhance	management's,	analysts'	and	
investors'	overall	understanding	of	the	company's	underlying	financial	performance	and	trends	and	facilitate	comparisons	among	current,	
past	and	future	periods.	
Because	the	non-GAAP	financial	measures	are	not	calculated	in	accordance	with	GAAP,	they	should	not	be	considered	superior	to	and	are	not	
intended	to	be	considered	in	isolation	or	as	a	substitute	for	the	related	GAAP	financial	measures	presented	in	the	press	release	and	may	not	
be	the	same	as	or	comparable	to	similarly	titled	measures	presented	by	other	companies	due	to	possible	differences	in	method	and	in	the	
items	being	adjusted.	We	encourage	investors	to	review	our	financial	statements	and	publicly-filed	reports	in	their	entirety	and	not	to	rely	on	
any	single	financial	measure.

The	company	does	not	provide	a	reconciliation	of	forward-looking	measures	where	the	company	believes	such	a	reconciliation	would	imply	a	
degree	of	precision	and	certainty	that	could	be	confusing	to	investors	and	is	unable	to	reasonably	predict	certain	items	contained	in	the	
GAAP	measures	without	unreasonable	efforts.	This	is	due	to	the	inherent	difficulty	of	forecasting	the	timing	or	amount	of	various	items	that	
have	not	yet	occurred	and	are	out	of	the	company's	control	or	cannot	be	reasonably	predicted.	For	the	same	reasons,	the	company	is	unable	
to	address	the	probable	significance	of	the	unavailable	information.	Forward-looking	non-GAAP	financial	measures	provided	without	the	
most	directly	comparable	GAAP	financial	measures	may	vary	materially	from	the	corresponding	GAAP	financial	measures.	See	"Cautionary	
Statement	Regarding	Forward-Looking	Statements"	above.	The	information	below	provides	an	explanation	of	certain	adjustments	reflected	
in	the	non-GAAP	financial	measures	and	shows	a	reconciliation	of	non-GAAP	financial	measures	reported	in	this	press	release	to	the	most	
directly	comparable	GAAP	financial	measures.	Within	the	financial	tables	presented,	certain	columns	and	rows	may	not	add	due	to	the	use	of	
rounded	numbers.	Percentages	and	earnings	per	share	amounts	presented	are	calculated	from	the	underlying	amounts.

CASM:	CASM	is	a	common	metric	used	in	the	airline	industry	to	measure	an	airline's	cost	structure	and	efficiency.	UAL	reports	CASM	
excluding	special	charges,	third-party	business	expenses,	fuel	expense,	profit	sharing	and	labor	contract	ratification	bonuses.	UAL	believes	
that	adjusting	for	special	charges	and	labor	contract	ratification	bonuses	is	useful	to	investors	because	those	items	are	not	indicative	of	UAL's	
ongoing	performance.	UAL	also	believes	that	excluding	third-party	business	expenses,	such	as	maintenance,	flight	academy,	ground	handling	
and	catering	services	for	third	parties,	provides	more	meaningful	disclosure	because	these	expenses	are	not	directly	related	to	UAL's	core	
business.	UAL	also	believes	that	excluding	fuel	expense	from	certain	measures	is	useful	to	investors	because	it	provides	an	additional	
measure	of	management's	performance	excluding	the	effects	of	a	significant	cost	item	over	which	management	has	limited	influence.	UAL	
excludes	profit	sharing	because	it	believes	that	this	exclusion	allows	investors	to	better	understand	and	analyze	UAL's	operating	cost	
performance	and	provides	a	more	meaningful	comparison	of	our	core	operating	costs	to	the	airline	industry.

Adjusted	EBITDA	and	EBITDAR:	UAL	also	reports	EBITDA	and	EBITDAR	excluding	special	charges,	nonoperating	unrealized	(gains)	losses	on	
investments,	net,	nonoperating	debt	extinguishment	and	modification	fees	and	nonoperating	special	termination	benefits.	UAL	believes	that	
adjusting	for	these	items	is	useful	to	investors	because	they	are	not	indicative	of	UAL's	ongoing	performance.	
Adjusted	Capital	Expenditures	and	Free	Cash	Flow:	UAL	believes	that	adjusting	capital	expenditures	for	assets	acquired	through	the	issuance	
of	debt,	finance	leases	and	other	financial	liabilities	is	useful	to	investors	in	order	to	appropriately	reflect	the	total	amounts	spent	on	capital	
expenditures.	UAL	also	believes	that	adjusting	net	cash	provided	by	(used	in)	operating	activities	for	capital	expenditures,	net	of	flight	
equipment	purchase	deposit	returns,	adjusted	capital	expenditures,	and	aircraft	operating	lease	additions	is	useful	to	allow	investors	to	
evaluate	the	company's	ability	to	generate	cash	that	is	available	for	debt	service	or	general	corporate	initiatives.

Adjusted	Total	Debt	and	Adjusted	Net	Debt:	Adjusted	total	debt	is	a	non-GAAP	financial	measure	that	includes	current	and	long-term	debt,	
operating	lease	obligations	and	finance	lease	obligations,	current	and	noncurrent	other	financial	liabilities	and	noncurrent	pension	and	
postretirement	obligations.	Adjusted	net	debt	is	adjusted	total	debt	minus	cash,	cash	equivalents	and	short-term	investments.	UAL	provides	
adjusted	total	debt	and	adjusted	net	debt	because	we	believe	these	measures	provide	useful	supplemental	information	for	assessing	the	
company's	debt	and	debt-like	obligation	profile.

Labor	contract	ratification	bonuses:	In	July	2023,	the	company	reached	an	Agreement	in	Principle	("AIP")	with	its	employees	represented	by	
the	Air	Line	Pilots	Association	regarding	a	contract	that	became	amendable	in	January	2019.	The	AIP	includes	numerous	work	rule	changes	
and	pay	rate	increases	during	the	four-year	term.	The	agreement	also	includes	a	provision	for	a	one-time	payment	upon	ratification.	In	the	
three	and	six	months	ended	June	30,	2023,	the	company	recorded	$765	million	of	expenses	associated	with	this	AIP	relating	to	wages	for	
2022	and	prior	years.	Also	on	May	1,	2023,	the	company	and	the	International	Association	of	Machinists	&	Aerospace	Workers	("IAM")	
ratified	five	contracts	covering	nearly	30,000	IAM-represented	fleet	service,	passenger	service,	storekeepers,	maintenance	instructors	and	
fleet	technical	instructors	and	related	employees.	The	company	recorded	a	one-time	$48	million	expense	in	conjunction	with	the	
ratification.

(Gains)	losses	on	sale	of	assets	and	other	special	charges:	During	the	three	and	six	months	ended	June	30,	2023,	the	company	recorded	$46	
million	and	$60	million,	respectively,	of	net	charges	primarily	comprised	of	reserves	for	various	legal	matters,	accelerated	depreciation	
related	to	certain	of	the	company's	assets	that	will	be	retired	early	and	other	gains	and	losses	on	the	sale	of	assets.

During	the	three	and	six	months	ended	June	30,	2022,	the	company	recorded	$112	million	and	$104	million,	respectively,	of	net	charges	
primarily	comprised	of	$94	million	for	various	legal	matters.

Nonoperating	unrealized	gains	on	investments,	net:	All	amounts	represent	changes	to	the	market	value	of	equity	investments.

Nonoperating	debt	extinguishment	and	modification	fees:	During	the	three	and	six	months	ended	June	30,	2023,	the	company	recorded	
$11	million	of	charges	primarily	related	to	the	prepayment	of	$1.0	billion	of	the	outstanding	principal	amount	under	a	2021	term	loan	
facility.

During	the	six	months	ended	June	30,	2022,	the	company	recorded	$7	million	of	charges	primarily	related	to	the	early	redemption	of	
$400	million	of	its	outstanding	principal	amount	of	the	4.25%	senior	notes	due	2022.

Effective	tax	rate:

The	company's	effective	tax	rates	were	as	follows:
Three	Months	Ended	June	30, Six	Months	Ended	June	30,

	 2023 2022 2023 2022
Effective	tax	rate 	22.5	% 	28.3	% 	22.1	% 	18.9	%

The	provision	for	income	taxes	for	the	three	and	six	months	ended	June	30,	2023	is	based	on	the	estimated	annual	effective	tax	rate,	which	
represents	a	blend	of	federal,	state	and	foreign	taxes	and	includes	the	impact	of	certain	nondeductible	items.	The	provision	for	income	
taxes	for	the	three	and	six	months	ended	June	30,	2022	was	calculated	using	a	discrete	effective	tax	rate	method.	We	determined	that	
applying	an	estimate	of	the	annual	effective	tax	rate	to	income	or	loss	for	the	interim	reporting	period	would	not	provide	a	reliable	estimate	
for	the	three	and	six	months	ended	June	30,	2022,	since	small	changes	in	estimated	income	would	have	resulted	in	significant	changes	in	
the	estimated	annual	effective	tax	rate.
