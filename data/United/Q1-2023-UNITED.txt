United Airlines Announces First-Quarter Financial 
Results: Continues to See Strong Demand for Air Travel 

 
Generated record high quarterly operating cash flow of over $3 billion 

 
Achieved the lowest mainline flight and seat cancellation rates of any U.S. airline despite having the most 

flights impacted by weather 
 

Q2 adjusted diluted EPS1 target of $3.50 to $4.00; reiterating full-year adjusted diluted EPS1 target of $10 
to $12  

 
Seeing strong international demand in Q2; international expansion twice the rate of domestic 

 
Cost trajectory on track for full-year flat CASM-ex2 target 

 

CHICAGO, April. 18, 2023 – United Airlines (UAL) today reported first-quarter 2023 financial 

results. The company reported a $256 million pre-tax loss, consistent with expectations provided in 

March. The company grew total operating revenue by 51.1% compared to first quarter 2022 and total 

revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) by 22.5%. Cost per available seat mile (CASM) increased 

4.0%, while CASM-ex2 came in at down 0.1%, better than guidance due to strong operational reliability 

that produced available seat miles (ASMs) 23.4% higher than the first quarter of 2022. The company 

remains confident in the 2023 United Next adjusted diluted earnings per share1 target of $10 to $12.  

"I am extremely proud of the United team's performance during the first quarter of 2023. Our 

industry-leading operational performance contributed to an all-time high operating cash flow in the first 

quarter and keeps us on track to achieve our cost targets for the full year," said United Airlines CEO Scott 

Kirby. "We are watching the macroeconomic risks carefully, but demand remains strong, especially 

internationally, where we are growing at twice the domestic rate. We expect all of these factors will keep 

us on track to achieve our full-year adjusted diluted EPS1 target." 

 
1 Adjusted diluted earnings per share is a measure that is not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and excludes operating and non-operating special charges (credits) and 
unrealized (gains) losses on investments, net. We are not providing a target for or a reconciliation to diluted earnings per share, 
the most directly comparable GAAP measure, because we are unable to predict the excluded items noted above contained in 
the GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts, and therefore we also are not able to predict the probable significance of such 
items. For additional information about the non-GAAP measures used in this press release, see "Non-GAAP Financial 
Information" below. 
2 CASM-ex (adjusted cost or operating expense per available seat mile) is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated as 
cost or operating expense per available seat mile ("CASM") excluding fuel expense, profit sharing, third-party business expenses 
and special charges (credits). We are not providing a target for or a reconciliation to CASM, the most directly comparable GAAP 
measure, because we are unable to predict the excluded items noted above contained in the GAAP measure without 
unreasonable efforts, and therefore we also are not able to determine the probable significance of such items. Please reference 
the investor update filed on April 18, 2023 for further details on this metric. For additional information about the non-GAAP 
measures used in this press release, see "Non-GAAP Financial Information" below.

orders, costs related to modification or termination of aircraft orders or entry into less favorable aircraft 
orders, as well as any inability to accept or integrate new aircraft into our fleet as planned; any failure to

issues or underperformance as compared to our expectations; the adverse impacts of the ongoing 
COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity; adverse 
publicity, harm to our brand, reduced travel demand, potential tort liability and voluntary or mandatory 
operational restrictions as a result of an accident, catastrophe or incident involving us, our regional 
carriers, our codeshare partners or another airline; the highly competitive nature of the global airline 
industry and susceptibility of the industry to price discounting and changes in capacity, including as a 
result of alliances, joint business arrangements or other consolidations; our reliance on a limited number 
of suppliers to source a majority of our aircraft and certain parts, and the impact of any failure to obtain 
timely deliveries, additional equipment or support from any of these suppliers; disruptions to our regional 
network and United Express flights provided by third-party regional carriers; unfavorable economic and 
political conditions in the United States and globally (including inflationary pressures); reliance on third-

infrastructure constrains at our hubs or other airports; geopolitical conflict, terrorist attacks or security 
events; any damage to our reputation or brand image; our reliance on technology and automated

and others; the impacts of union disputes, employee strikes or slowdowns, and other labor-related 
disruptions or regulatory compliance costs on our operations; any failure to attract, train or retain skilled 
personnel, including our senior management team or other key employees; the monetary and operational 
costs of compliance with extensive government regulation of the airline industry; current or future 
litigation and regulatory actions, or failure to comply with the terms of any settlement, order or 
arrangement relating to these actions; costs, liabilities and risks associated with environmental regulation 
and climate change, including our climate goals; high and/or volatile fuel prices or significant disruptions 
in the supply of aircraft fuel (including as a result of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict); the impacts of

Non-GAAP Financial Information: 
In discussing financial results and guidance, the company refers to financial measures that are not in 
accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial 
measures are provided as supplemental information to the financial measures presented in this press 
release that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and are presented because 
management believes that they supplement or enhance management's, analysts' and investors' overall 
understanding of the company's underlying financial performance and trends and facilitate comparisons 
among current, past and future periods. Non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted operating 
margin (which excludes special charges (credits)), CASM-ex (which excludes the impact of fuel expense, 
profit sharing, special charges and third-party expenses), adjusted pre-tax margin (which is calculated as 
pre-tax margin excluding operating and nonoperating special charges (credits) and unrealized (gains) 
losses on investments, net) and adjusted net income typically have exclusions or adjustments that 
include one or more of the following characteristics, such as being highly variable, difficult to project, 
unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of past or future 
operating results. These items are excluded because the company believes they neither relate to the 
ordinary course of the company's business nor reflect the company's underlying business performance. 
 
Because the non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not 
be considered superior to and are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the 
related GAAP financial measures presented in the press release and may not be the same as or 
comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to possible differences in 
method and in the items being adjusted. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and 
publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 
 
Please refer to the tables accompanying this release for a description of the non-GAAP adjustments and 
reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP financial measures used to the most comparable GAAP 
financial measure and related disclosures.

measures presented in this press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and are presented because management believes that 
they supplement or enhance management's, analysts' and investors' overall understanding of the company's underlying financial performance and trends 
and facilitate comparisons among current, past and future periods.  
 
Because the non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered superior to and are not intended to 
be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP financial measures presented in the press release and may not be the same as or 
comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items being adjusted. We encourage 
investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 
 
The company does not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking measures where the company believes such a reconciliation would imply a degree of 
precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors and is unable to reasonably predict certain items contained in the GAAP measures without 
unreasonable efforts. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have not yet occurred and are out of the 
company's control or cannot be reasonably predicted. For the same reasons, the company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable 
information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially 
from the corresponding GAAP financial measures. See "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" above. 

The information below provides an explanation of certain adjustments reflected in the non-GAAP financial measures and shows a reconciliation of non-GAAP 
financial measures reported in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Within the financial tables presented, certain 
columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages and earnings per share amounts presented are calculated from the 
underlying amounts. 

CASM is a common metric used in the airline industry to measure an airline's cost structure and efficiency. UAL reports CASM excluding special charges 
(credits), third-party business expenses, fuel expense and profit sharing. UAL believes that adjusting for special charges (credits) is useful to investors 
because special charges (credits) are not indicative of UAL's ongoing performance. UAL also believes that excluding third-party business expenses, such as 
maintenance, flight academy, ground handling and catering services for third parties, provides more meaningful disclosure because these expenses are not 
directly related to UAL's core business. UAL also believes that excluding fuel expense from certain measures is useful to investors because it provides an 
additional measure of management's performance excluding the effects of a significant cost item over which management has limited influence. UAL 
excludes profit sharing because it believes that this exclusion allows investors to better understand and analyze UAL's operating cost performance and 
provides a more meaningful comparison of our core operating costs to the airline industry (due to losses, profit sharing was zero for the periods presented).

UAL believes that adjusting capital expenditures for assets acquired through the issuance of debt, finance leases and other financial liabilities is useful to 
investors in order to appropriately reflect the total amounts spent on capital expenditures. UAL also believes that adjusting net cash provided by (used in) 
operating activities for capital expenditures, net of flight equipment purchase deposit returns, adjusted capital expenditures, and aircraft operating lease 
additions is useful to allow investors to evaluate the company's ability to generate cash that is available for debt service or general corporate initiatives.

(Gains) losses on sale of assets and other special charges: During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the company recorded $14 million of net 
charges primarily comprised of accelerated depreciation related to certain of the company's assets that will be retired early and other gains and losses on the 
sale of assets. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the company recorded net gains of $8 million primarily related to sale-leaseback transactions and the sale of 
aircraft. 

Nonoperating unrealized gains on investments, net: All amounts represent changes to the market value of equity investments. 

Nonoperating debt extinguishment and modification fees: During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the company recorded $7 million of charges 
primarily related to the early redemption of $400 million of its outstanding principal amount of the 4.25% senior notes due 2022. 

  

Effective tax rate: 

The company's effective tax rates were as follows: 

 Three Months Ended March 31, 
  2023  2022 

Effective tax rate 24.2 % 21.4 % 

The provision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2023 is based on the estimated annual effective tax rate, which represents a blend of 
federal, state and foreign taxes and includes the impact of certain nondeductible items. The provision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 
2022 is calculated using a discrete effective tax rate method. We determined that applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate to income or loss for 
the interim reporting period would not provide a reliable estimate for the three months ended March 31, 2022, since small changes in estimated income 
would have resulted in significant changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate.
