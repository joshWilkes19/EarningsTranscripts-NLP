United Airlines Announces Third-Quarter 2024 Financial Results: 
Exceeds Earnings Per Share Expectations  

 
Announces $1.5 billion share repurchase program 

 
Year-to-date generated $7.2 billion of operating cash flow and $3.4 billion free cash flow 

 
Company sees revenue trends improve as industry reached an inflection point in the quarter 

 
 

CHICAGO, Oct. 15, 2024 – United Airlines (UAL) today reported third-quarter 2024 financial results. The 

company had pre-tax earnings of $1.3 billion, with a pre-tax margin of 8.7%; adjusted pre-tax earnings1 of $1.4 

billion, with an adjusted pre-tax margin1 of 9.7%. The company also achieved diluted earnings per share of $2.90; 

adjusted diluted earnings per share1 of $3.33, ahead of the third-quarter 2024 guidance provided at the start of 

the quarter of $2.75 to $3.25.  

The company produced strong financial and operational results in the quarter. As the company expected, 

revenue trends improved as the industry reached an inflection point in the quarter with unprofitable capacity 

exiting the market. Domestic unit revenue was positive year-over-year in August and September. Demand 

continues to be strong for the United product: Corporate revenues were up 13% year over year in September, and 

in the quarter premium revenues continued to remain resilient and were up 5% year over year and revenue from 

Basic Economy was up 20% year over year. 

"I appreciate the entire United team coming together to take care of our customers by operating a safe 

and on-time airline this summer," said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby. "As predicted, unproductive capacity left 

the market in mid-August, and we saw a clear inflection point in our revenue trends that propelled United to 

exceed Q3 expectations. A prosperous summer 2024 is just the beginning as our improved customer experience 

combined with United Next positions the airline at the top of the industry for the foreseeable future."   

 

Capital Allocation 

The company's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to $1.5 billion of 

outstanding shares of common stock and warrants originally issued to the U.S. Treasury under the CARES Act and 

Payroll Support Program, subject to a limit of $500 million in aggregate through year-end 2024. This amount 

represents approximately 7% percent of the company's market capitalization based on the closing stock price on 

Oct 14, 2024. This is the first share repurchase program since the suspension of the previous program in 2020 due

to the COVID-19 pandemic. Unless suspended or terminated earlier by our Board of Directors, this program has no 

set expiration date and will therefore terminate when the company has completed all purchases authorized under 

the program. 

"In the last four years, we've invested $22 billion in our product and nearly $10 billion in our people. Those 

investments have enabled higher profits and are now contributing to growing free cash flow," said United Airlines 

CFO Michael Leskinen. "We're now in a position to add a share repurchase program as we continue to invest in and 

deleverage our business. We are simultaneously targeting net leverage2 below 2x in the next few years. We intend 

this buyback to be the beginning of a consistent and disciplined return of capital that is paced by our ability to 

generate increasing levels of free cash." 

In the quarter, the company repurchased in the open market just over 2 million shares of UAL common 

stock in connection with the exercise of roughly 6.4 million warrants issued to the U.S. Treasury under the CARES 

Act and Payroll Support Program. The repurchase of these shares eliminated the dilution associated with the 

warrants exercised and are separate from the $1.5 billion share repurchase program above. The shares were 

purchased at an average price of $39.99. 

Under today's $1.5 billion share repurchase program shares may be repurchased in the open market and in 

privately negotiated transactions, as well as accelerated repurchase agreements, depending on the capital needs 

of the business, the market price of UAL common stock, general market conditions, securities law limitations and 

other factors. 

 
2 Net leverage is a non-GAAP measure that is equal to adjusted net debt divided by trailing twelve month adjusted EBITDAR. We are not providing a target for 
or a reconciliation to total debt or net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measures, because we are unable to predict special charges (credits) and 
unrealized (gains) losses on investments contained in the GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts, and therefore we also are not able to predict the 
probable significance of such items contained in the GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts, and therefore we also are not able to predict the probable 
significance of such items. For additional information about the non-GAAP measures used in this press release, see "Non-GAAP Financial Information" below.

expectations; adverse publicity, harm to our brand, reduced travel demand, potential tort liability and operational restrictions 
as a result of an accident, catastrophe or incident involving us, our regional carriers, our codeshare partners or another airline;

the Middle East, as well as any escalation of the broader economic consequences of these conflicts beyond their current 
scope); any damage to our reputation or brand image; our reliance on technology and automated systems to operate our

and other labor-related disruptions or regulatory compliance costs on our operations or financial performance; any failure to 
attract, train or retain skilled personnel, including our senior management team or other key employees; the monetary and 
operational costs of compliance with extensive government regulation of the airline industry; current or future litigation and 
regulatory actions, or failure to comply with the terms of any settlement, order or agreement relating to these actions; costs, 
liabilities and risks associated with environmental regulation and climate change, and any failure to achieve or demonstrate 
progress towards our climate goals; high and/or volatile fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel; the 
impacts of our significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations and the impacts of insufficient liquidity on our 
financial condition and business; failure to comply with financial and other covenants governing our debt, including our 
MileagePlus financing agreements; limitations on our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax 
attributes to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes; our failure to realize the full value of our 
intangible assets or our long-lived assets, causing us to record impairments; fluctuations in the price of our common stock; the 
impacts of seasonality, and other factors associated with the airline industry; increases in insurance costs or inadequate 
insurance coverage; risks relating to our repurchase program for shares of common stock and certain warrants exercisable for

In discussing financial results and guidance, the company refers to financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"). The non-GAAP financial measures are provided as supplemental 
information to the financial measures presented in this press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with 
GAAP and are presented because management believes that they supplement or enhance management's, analysts' and 
investors' overall understanding of the company's underlying financial performance and trends and facilitate comparisons 
among current, past and future periods. Non-GAAP financial measures such as CASM-ex (which excludes the impact of fuel

margin excluding operating and nonoperating special charges, unrealized (gains) losses on investments, net and debt 
extinguishment and modification fees), adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted net income, and net 
leverage typically have exclusions or adjustments that include one or more of the following characteristics, such as being 
highly variable, difficult to project, unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of past or

future operating results. These items are excluded because the company believes they neither relate to the ordinary course of 
the company's business nor reflect the company's underlying business performance. 
 
Because the non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered 
superior to and are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP financial measures 
presented in the press release and may not be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other 
companies due to possible differences in method and in the items being adjusted. We encourage investors to review our 
financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

1 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

UAL evaluates its financial performance utilizing various accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and 
non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (adjusted EBITDA), adjusted 
EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA excluding aircraft rent (adjusted EBITDAR), adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted operating margin, 
adjusted pre-tax income (loss), adjusted pre-tax margin, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share, CASM-ex, 
adjusted capital expenditures, adjusted total debt, adjusted net debt, net leverage, free cash flow, and free cash flow, net of financings, 
among others. The non-GAAP financial measures are provided as supplemental information to the financial measures presented in this press 
release that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and are presented because management believes that they supplement 
or enhance management's, analysts' and investors' overall understanding of the company's underlying financial performance and trends and 
facilitate comparisons among current, past and future periods.  
Because the non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered superior to and are not 
intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP financial measures presented in the press release and may not 
be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the 
items being adjusted. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on 
any single financial measure. 

The company does not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking measures where the company believes such a reconciliation would imply a 
degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors and is unable to reasonably predict certain items contained in the GAAP 
measures without unreasonable efforts. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have 
not yet occurred and are out of the company's control or cannot be reasonably predicted. For the same reasons, the company is unable to 
address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most 
directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures. See "Cautionary 
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" above. The information below provides an explanation of certain adjustments reflected in 
the non-GAAP financial measures and shows a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures reported in this press release to the most 
directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Within the financial tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of 
rounded numbers. Percentages and earnings per share amounts presented are calculated from the underlying amounts. 

CASM: CASM is a common metric used in the airline industry to measure an airline's cost structure and efficiency. UAL reports CASM 
excluding special charges, third-party business expenses, fuel expense, and profit sharing. UAL believes that adjusting for special charges is 
useful to investors because those items are not indicative of UAL's ongoing performance. UAL also believes that excluding third-party business 
expenses, such as maintenance, flight academy, ground handling and catering services for third parties, provides more meaningful disclosure 
because these expenses are not directly related to UAL's core business. UAL also believes that excluding fuel expense from certain measures 
is useful to investors because it provides an additional measure of management's performance excluding the effects of a significant cost item 
over which management has limited influence. UAL excludes profit sharing because it believes that this exclusion allows investors to better 
understand and analyze UAL's operating cost performance and provides a more meaningful comparison of our core operating costs to the 
airline industry. 

Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDAR: UAL also reports EBITDA and EBITDAR excluding special charges, nonoperating unrealized (gains) losses on 
investments, net and nonoperating debt extinguishment and modification fees. UAL believes that adjusting for these items is useful to 
investors because they are not indicative of UAL's ongoing performance.  
Adjusted Capital Expenditures and Free Cash Flow: UAL believes that adjusting capital expenditures for assets acquired through the issuance 
of debt, finance leases and other financial liabilities is useful to investors in order to appropriately reflect the total amounts spent on capital 
expenditures. UAL also believes that adjusting net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for capital expenditures, net of flight 
equipment purchase deposit returns, adjusted capital expenditures, and aircraft operating lease additions is useful to allow investors to 
evaluate the company's ability to generate cash that is available for debt service or general corporate initiatives. 
Adjusted Total Debt and Adjusted Net Debt: Adjusted total debt is a non-GAAP financial measure that includes current and long-term debt, 
operating lease obligations and finance lease obligations, current and noncurrent other financial liabilities and noncurrent pension and 
postretirement obligations. Adjusted net debt is adjusted total debt minus cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. UAL provides 
adjusted total debt and adjusted net debt because we believe these measures provide useful supplemental information for assessing the 
company's debt and debt-like obligation profile.  
Net Leverage: Net leverage is a non-GAAP financial measure that is equal to adjusted net debt divided by trailing twelve month adjusted 
EBITDAR. UAL provides net leverage because we believe it provides useful supplemental information for assessing the company's debt level.
