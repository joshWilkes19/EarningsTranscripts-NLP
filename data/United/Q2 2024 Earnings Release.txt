United Airlines Announces Second-Quarter 2024 Financial 
Results; Achieves 2Q EPS Expectations 

 
 2Q pre-tax margin expected to be among industry leaders, despite excess industry capacity in the domestic market 

 
Expect best unit revenue performance among large peers 

 
United's key revenue diversity advantages – Premium revenue, Basic Economy revenue and market share shift 

among domestic road warriors – gained additional momentum in 2Q 
 

Sees mid-August as inflection point when industry-wide oversupply eases and United is best positioned to benefit 
 

CHICAGO, July 17, 2024 – United Airlines (UAL) today reported second-quarter 2024 financial results. The 

company had pre-tax earnings of $1.7 billion, with a pre-tax margin of 11.6%; adjusted pre-tax earnings1 of $1.8 

billion, with an adjusted pre-tax margin1 of 12.1%. The company expects pre-tax margin to be near the top of the 

industry. The company also achieved diluted earnings per share of $3.96; adjusted diluted earnings per share1 of 

$4.14, in line with second-quarter 2024 guidance provided at the start of the quarter. The company continues to 

expect full-year 2024 adjusted diluted earnings per share2 of $9 to $11. 

For nearly two years, the airline has been anticipating significant domestic capacity reductions recently 

announced by a variety of U.S. airlines this summer and mid-August is an inflection point, with published schedule 

changes showing an approximately 3 point decline in industry capacity growth rate. The airline expects three 

critical revenue diversity advantages that propelled it to the top of the industry during this challenging period to 

further accelerate. The first, premium revenue, grew 8.5% in the second quarter versus the same quarter last year. 

The second, Basic Economy revenue, grew 38% year-over-year during the quarter. The third, market share among 

domestic road warriors, increased during the quarter year-over-year.    

"The revenue diversity advantages that we've built with our premium customers, Basic Economy 

customers, and domestic road warriors, on top of the world's best loyalty program and leading customer service, 

have propelled our margins to near the top of the industry," said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby. "Looking forward, 

we see multiple airlines have begun to cancel loss-making capacity, and we expect leading unit revenue 

performance among our largest peers in the second half of the third quarter. United has long been preparing for

we are unable to predict the excluded items noted above contained in the GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts, and therefore we also are not able to

the moment when industry wide domestic capacity would adjust - it's now clear that inflection point is just 30 days 

away." 

United has also continued to strategically manage the business in the face of industry wide challenges. 

United reduced costs and delivered CASM of down 4.8% and better-than-expected CASM-ex1 of up 2.1%. The 

airline also generated net cash provided by operating activities of $2.9 billion and $1.9 billion of free cash flow1 in 

the quarter. In early July, the company voluntarily prepaid the remaining balance of the high-cost MileagePlus term 

loan, totaling $1.8 billion, which further strengthens its balance sheet and reduces the airline's interest burden in 

the years ahead. The airline ended the quarter with trailing twelve months adjusted net debt to EBITDAR of 2.6x3. 

Looking ahead, United has also reduced planned domestic capacity by approximately 3 points in the fourth 

quarter, compared to the company's previous plan – reflecting the airline's firm commitment to taking its own 

action to adjust to current trends.  

"At United, we have been effectively managing costs, cash and capacity against a challenging industry 

backdrop because we're focused on doing what's necessary to hit our financial targets. Thank you to leaders across 

the company for embracing a 'no excuses' approach to running our business. It gives me confidence in our ability 

to achieve our $9-$11 EPS2 goal for 2024, despite the challenges the industry has faced this year," said Kirby. 

 
3 Trailing twelve month adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDAR is a non-GAAP financial measure. For additional information and reconciliations of adjusted net 
debt to total debt, the most comparable GAAP measure, and of adjusted EBITDAR to net income, the most comparable GAAP measure, please see “NON-

uncertainties cannot be predicted, guaranteed or assured. All forward-looking statements in this release are based upon 
information available to us on the date of this release. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-
looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise, except as 
required by applicable law or regulation. 
 
Our actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements due to numerous factors including, without 
limitation, the following: execution risks associated with our strategic operating plan; changes in our fleet and network 
strategy or other factors outside our control resulting in less economic aircraft orders, costs related to modification or 
termination of aircraft orders or entry into aircraft orders on less favorable terms, as well as any inability to accept or integrate 
new aircraft into our fleet as planned, including as a result of any mandatory groundings of aircraft; any failure to effectively 
manage, and receive anticipated benefits and returns from, acquisitions, divestitures, investments, joint ventures and other 
portfolio actions, or related exposures to unknown liabilities or other issues or underperformance as compared to our 
expectations; adverse publicity, harm to our brand, reduced travel demand, potential tort liability and operational restrictions 
as a result of an accident, catastrophe or incident involving us, our regional carriers, our codeshare partners or another airline; 
the highly competitive nature of the global airline industry and susceptibility of the industry to price discounting and changes 
in capacity, including as a result of alliances, joint business arrangements or other consolidations; our reliance on a limited 
number of suppliers to source a majority of our aircraft, engines and certain parts, and the impact of any failure to obtain 
timely deliveries, additional equipment or support from any of these suppliers; disruptions to our regional network and United 
Express flights provided by third-party regional carriers; unfavorable economic and political conditions in the United States 
and globally; reliance on third-party service providers and the impact of any significant failure of these parties to perform as 
expected, or interruptions in our relationships with these providers or their provision of services; extended interruptions or 
disruptions in service at major airports where we operate and space, facility and infrastructure constraints at our hubs or 
other airports; geopolitical conflict, terrorist attacks or security events (including the suspension of our overflying in Russian 
airspace as a result of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict and interruptions of our flying to Tel Aviv as a result of the Israeli-
Hamas military conflict, as well as any escalation of the broader economic consequences of these conflicts beyond their 
current scope); any damage to our reputation or brand image; our reliance on technology and automated systems to operate 
our business and the impact of any significant failure or disruption of, or failure to effectively integrate and implement, these 
technologies or systems; increasing privacy, data security and cybersecurity obligations or a significant data breach; increased 
use of social media platforms by us, our employees and others; the impacts of union disputes, employee strikes or slowdowns, 
and other labor-related disruptions or regulatory compliance costs on our operations or financial performance; any failure to 
attract, train or retain skilled personnel, including our senior management team or other key employees; the monetary and 
operational costs of compliance with extensive government regulation of the airline industry; current or future litigation and 
regulatory actions, or failure to comply with the terms of any settlement, order or agreement relating to these actions; costs, 
liabilities and risks associated with environmental regulation and climate change, and any failure to achieve or demonstrate 
progress towards our climate goals; high and/or volatile fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel; the 
impacts of our significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations and the impacts of insufficient liquidity on our 
financial condition and business; failure to comply with financial and other covenants governing our debt, including our 
MileagePlus financing agreements; limitations on our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax 
attributes to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes; our failure to realize the full value of our 
intangible assets or our long-lived assets, causing us to record impairments; fluctuations in the price of our common stock; the 
impacts of seasonality, and other factors associated with the airline industry; increases in insurance costs or inadequate 
insurance coverage and other risks and uncertainties set forth in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-
K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and under "Economic and Market Factors" and "Governmental Actions" in Part 
I, Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Quarterly Report on 
Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024, as well as other risks and uncertainties set forth from time to time in 
the reports we file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"). The non-GAAP financial measures are provided as supplemental 
information to the financial measures presented in this press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with 
GAAP and are presented because management believes that they supplement or enhance management's, analysts' and 
investors' overall understanding of the company's underlying financial performance and trends and facilitate comparisons 
among current, past and future periods. Non-GAAP financial measures such as CASM-ex (which excludes the impact of fuel

margin excluding operating and nonoperating special charges, unrealized (gains) losses on investments, net and debt 
extinguishment and modification fees), adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted net income

variable, difficult to project, unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of past or future

operating results. These items are excluded because the company believes they neither relate to the ordinary course of the 
company's business nor reflect the company's underlying business performance. 
 
Because the non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered 
superior to and are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP financial measures 
presented in the press release and may not be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other 
companies due to possible differences in method and in the items being adjusted. We encourage investors to review our 
financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

1 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

UAL evaluates its financial performance utilizing various accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and 
non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (adjusted EBITDA), adjusted 
EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA excluding aircraft rent (adjusted EBITDAR), adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted operating margin, 
adjusted pre-tax income (loss), adjusted pre-tax margin, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share, CASM-ex, 
adjusted capital expenditures, adjusted total debt, adjusted net debt, free cash flow, and free cash flow, net of financings, among others. The 
non-GAAP financial measures are provided as supplemental information to the financial measures presented in this press release that are 
calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and are presented because management believes that they supplement or enhance 
management's, analysts' and investors' overall understanding of the company's underlying financial performance and trends and facilitate 
comparisons among current, past and future periods.  
Because the non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered superior to and are not 
intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP financial measures presented in the press release and may not 
be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the 
items being adjusted. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on 
any single financial measure. 

The company does not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking measures where the company believes such a reconciliation would imply a 
degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors and is unable to reasonably predict certain items contained in the GAAP 
measures without unreasonable efforts. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have 
not yet occurred and are out of the company's control or cannot be reasonably predicted. For the same reasons, the company is unable to 
address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most 
directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures. See "Cautionary 
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" above. The information below provides an explanation of certain adjustments reflected in 
the non-GAAP financial measures and shows a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures reported in this press release to the most 
directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Within the financial tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of 
rounded numbers. Percentages and earnings per share amounts presented are calculated from the underlying amounts. 

CASM: CASM is a common metric used in the airline industry to measure an airline's cost structure and efficiency. UAL reports CASM 
excluding special charges, third-party business expenses, fuel expense, and profit sharing. UAL believes that adjusting for special charges is 
useful to investors because those items are not indicative of UAL's ongoing performance. UAL also believes that excluding third-party business 
expenses, such as maintenance, flight academy, ground handling and catering services for third parties, provides more meaningful disclosure 
because these expenses are not directly related to UAL's core business. UAL also believes that excluding fuel expense from certain measures 
is useful to investors because it provides an additional measure of management's performance excluding the effects of a significant cost item 
over which management has limited influence. UAL excludes profit sharing because it believes that this exclusion allows investors to better 
understand and analyze UAL's operating cost performance and provides a more meaningful comparison of our core operating costs to the 
airline industry. 

Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDAR: UAL also reports EBITDA and EBITDAR excluding special charges, nonoperating unrealized (gains) losses on 
investments, net and nonoperating debt extinguishment and modification fees. UAL believes that adjusting for these items is useful to 
investors because they are not indicative of UAL's ongoing performance.  
Adjusted Capital Expenditures and Free Cash Flow: UAL believes that adjusting capital expenditures for assets acquired through the issuance 
of debt, finance leases and other financial liabilities is useful to investors in order to appropriately reflect the total amounts spent on capital 
expenditures. UAL also believes that adjusting net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for capital expenditures, net of flight 
equipment purchase deposit returns, adjusted capital expenditures, and aircraft operating lease additions is useful to allow investors to 
evaluate the company's ability to generate cash that is available for debt service or general corporate initiatives. 
Adjusted Total Debt and Adjusted Net Debt: Adjusted total debt is a non-GAAP financial measure that includes current and long-term debt, 
operating lease obligations and finance lease obligations, current and noncurrent other financial liabilities and noncurrent pension and 
postretirement obligations. Adjusted net debt is adjusted total debt minus cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. UAL provides 
adjusted total debt and adjusted net debt because we believe these measures provide useful supplemental information for assessing the 
company's debt and debt-like obligation profile.
