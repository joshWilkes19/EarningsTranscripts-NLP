COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL  SEP 26, 2023

Presentation
....................................................................................................................................................................

Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Costco Wholesale Corporation Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year
2023 Operating Results Call. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to
turn the conference over to Richard Galanti, CFO. Please go ahead, sir.
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will
include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or
performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties
include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as others identified from time to time
in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only
as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as
required by law.
In today's press release, we reported operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23, the 17 weeks
ended September 3. These results and the figures presented today compare to last fiscal year's 16-week
fourth quarter. Reported net income for the 17-week fourth quarter came in at $2.16 billion or $4.86 per
diluted share compared to $1.868 billion or $4.20 per diluted share in the 16-week fourth quarter last
year.
In terms of sales, net sales for the 17-week fourth quarter were $77.43 billion, an increase of 9.4% from
$70.76 billion in the 16-week fourth quarter last year. Comparable sales for the fourth quarter and these
figures are like-for-like number of weeks. In the U.S., reported was a 0.2% comp. Excluding gas, deflation
and FX, in the U.S., it would have been at 3.1%. Canada reported was a 1.8% and excluding gas deflation
and FX, 7.4%. Other International reported 5.5% and again, excluding gas deflation and FX, 4.4%. All
told, total company reported 1.1% comp and a 3.8% ex gas deflation and FX.
In terms of e-commerce, that was -- came in at a minus 0.8% reported and a minus 0.6% excluding
FX. Overall, for the fiscal fourth quarter, food and sundries were relatively strong once again, with fresh
foods right behind and with some offsets on some of the nonfoods categories. In terms of Q4 comp sales
metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 5.2% worldwide and 5.0% in the United States. Our
average transaction or ticket was down 3.9% worldwide and down 4.5% in the U.S., impacted in large
part from weakness in bigger ticket nonfoods discretionary items as well as the gas price deflation. Foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impact sales by approximately 0.3%, and gasoline price
deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 2.5%.
Next, on the income statement, membership fee income reported in the fourth quarter $1.509 billion or
1.95% of sales in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year compared to $1.27 billion or 1.88% in Q4 of last
year, so a $182 million increase or 13.7%. If you adjust for the extra week, the 13.7% would be roughly a
7% ex that extra week. Excluding FX and the extra week, the increase would have been around 7.5%.
In terms of renewal rates, at Q4 end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rates stood at 92.7%, which is up
0.1% from the 92.6% figure as of the end of Q3. The worldwide rate came in at 90.4%, down 0.1%,
reflecting the impact of increasing penetration of memberships from international, which renew at a lower
rate in large part because of new openings internationally.
Membership growth continues. We ended the fourth quarter with 71.0 million paid household members,
up 7.9% versus a year ago; and 127.9 million cardholders, up 7.6% and that's new openings over the
past year of just under 3% increase in new locations. At fourth quarter end, we had 32.3 million paid
executive memberships, an increase of 981,000 during the 17 weeks since Q3 end. Executive Members

COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL  SEP 26, 2023

now represent a little over 45% of our paid membership and approximately -- paid members and
approximately 73% of worldwide sales.
Moving down the income statement. Next is our gross margin. Our reported gross margin in the fourth
quarter came in higher -- came in at 10.60%, up 42 basis points from 10.18% a year ago, and at 42 basis
points is up 16 basis points, excluding gas deflation. As I always ask you to jot down a few numbers with
2 columns, both reported and excluding gas deflation, the first line item would be core merchandise, on a
reported basis, up 51 basis points year-over-year in the fourth quarter and ex gas deflation, up 28 basis
points; ancillary and other businesses, a minus 32 and a minus 38; 2% Reward, minus 4 and minus 2;
LIFO plus 27 and plus 28, and you total that up, on a reported basis, gross margin was up 42 basis points
year-over-year and ex gas deflation, up 16 basis points.
Starting with the core, again, up 51 year-over-year and ex deflation, up 28. In terms of core margin on
their own sales, our core-on-core margins were higher by 35 basis points, with food and sundries and
nonfoods being up and fresh foods being down a little. Ancillary and other business gross margin was
lower by 32 basis points and lower by 38 basis points ex gas. This decrease was driven almost entirely
by gas. If you look at the other components of ancillary and other, which would include pharmacy, e-com,
food court, business centers, optical, all those things on a relative basis year-over-year were in a couple of
basis points plus or minus from a year earlier.
2% Reward, higher by 4 and higher by 2 basis points, so a negative 2 basis points, excluding gas
deflation. That represents higher sales penetration coming from our Executive Members.
And LIFO, of course, if you recall last year in Q4, we had a $223 million pretax LIFO charge. While there
was a small charge this year of $30 million on a year-over-year basis, of course, that showed the basis
point improvement in margin. While we continue to see sequential improvement in year-over-year
inflation, I'll talk about that a little later. We still had a small amount relative to the first day of the fiscal
year. That's the small charge in Q4.
A couple of final comments on margins. First, we are asked often recently about our inventory shrinkage
results and whether it has dramatically increased in the past year versus historical shrink results. The
answer is no. In the past several years, our inventory shrink has increased by a couple of basis points, in
part, we believe, due to the rollout of self-checkout. Over the past year, it has increased by less than 1
basis point more. So no, thankfully, not a big issue for us.
And second, the year-over-year margin improvement has in part been due to fewer markdowns due to
better inventory positions this year than last. Our inventories overall are in good shape.
Moving on to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the fourth quarter, 8.96%, up from 8.53% a year earlier or
up 43 basis points and ex gas deflation, up 21 basis points. Again, jot down the 2 columns of numbers,
both reported and excluding gas deflation: operations, minus 37 basis points, minus being higher by, and
without deflation, core would be minus 18; central, minus 6 and minus 3, and those are the really only 2
items. The others were all 0 stock compensation, preopening and other. So total reported margins were up
43 basis points year-over-year and ex gas deflation, up 21 basis points.
In terms of the core operations being higher by 18 ex gas deflation and on a reported basis, higher by 37,
this negative included the impact of lower sales growth as well as the impact of 8 weeks of additional top-
of-scale wage increases that went into effect July 4, 2022, so midway through Q4 last year, and a full 17
weeks of this past March is higher than normal top-scale increase. Central being higher by 3 basis points
ex gas deflation, again, not a lot of sales operating leverage there. And again, as I mentioned, the other
line items that I typically read out were flat, both with and without gas deflation, so 0 year-over-year
change.
Below the operating income line, interest expense came in at $56 million this year versus $48 million a
year ago, 1 extra week of course. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $171 million
year-over-year, $238 million this year versus $67 million last year. This was driven in large part by an
increase in interest income due to both higher interest rates and higher cash balances as well as the extra
week. In addition, FX was slightly favorable year-over-year.

COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL  SEP 26, 2023

In terms of income tax rate, our tax rate this year in the fourth quarter came in 27.1% compared to
25.4% in Q4 last year, so a full 1.7 percentage points higher year-over-year. This increase in our rate as
of Q4 is primarily attributable to an increased penetration of international earnings, which overall incurs
a higher income tax rate than in the U.S. Overall, reported net income was up 16% year-over-year in the
quarter or 9% if you adjust for the extra week this year in fourth quarter versus last.
A few other items of note. In the fourth quarter, we opened 9 net new warehouses, including 5 new
buildings in the U.S., 2 in China and 1 each in Japan and Australia. That -- for the full fiscal '23 year, we
finished with 23 net new units as well as we did 3 relocations. And for the first quarter, the first 12 weeks
of fiscal '24, we plan on opening 10 net new units and as well relocating 1 unit. All 10 locations, net new
are -- 9 are in the U.S. and 1 are in Canada.
Regarding capital expenditures, we've actually included the cash flow in the quarterly report, but CapEx
spend in Q4 was approximately $1.56 billion. And for all of fiscal '23, it totaled $4.32 billion.
Turning to e-commerce. E-commerce sales in the fourth quarter ex FX, as I mentioned, decreased 0.6%
year-over-year. While still negative, relatively speaking, our e-commerce showed good improvement --
results showed good improvement this quarter versus our year-over-year results in Q2 and Q3. In the
previous 2 fiscal quarters, big ticket discretionary, majors, home furnishings, small electrics, jewelry and
hardware were down 15% and 20% year-over-year, respectively, and down just 5% year-over-year in the
fourth quarter, with those big ticket departments making up over half of our e-commerce sales.
A couple other items of note. Within the sales of big ticket discretionary, appliance were up over 30% in
the quarter. Second, I've gotten a couple of calls that people have seen online that we've been selling 1-
ounce gold bars. Yes, but when we load them on the site, they're typically gone within a few hours, and
we limit 2 per member.
And lastly, I'll point out Costco Next. We continue to grow that. We currently have 62 suppliers on
costconext.com, and we're continuing to onboard additional ones in many product areas from home
improvement to apparel to pet to home and kitchen to electronics and accessories to sports and bicycles
and toys and the like.
Now a few comments on e-com mobile digital efforts, which we're always asked about. As I discussed
during the last quarter earnings call, when I said that we were in the early innings of our digital mobile
transformation efforts, progress is being made. In terms of recent additions and upgrades, we recently
redesigned the account page in the digital membership card. We also redesigned a header with larger
search bar and expanded selling space. We've added an app box for messages and advertisements right in
the app. We've recently, a few months ago, opened an optical digital store where you can virtually try on
glasses and then order them for pickup, prescription glasses.
And lastly, there are ongoing improvement in our Costco app, offering in-warehouse shopping tools
to our customers such as a digital membership card, managing shopping lists, viewing warehouse
savings, seeing the gas prices to the extent there's a gas station there. And soon, you'll be able to search
warehouse inventory and scan barcodes from the app. With the improvements made thus far over the
past year, our App Store rating has gone from a dismal 2.3 stars to currently 4.7 stars. Unique visitors in
the site are up 40% year-over-year, and the Costco app installs are up 46% year-over-year. So all in all,
progress is being made.
Lastly, a couple of comments regarding inflation. Most recently, in Q3 '23, we had estimated that year-
over-year inflation was in the 3% to 4% range. Our estimate for Q4 was inflation in the 1% to 2% range,
and it's actually trended downward during the quarter. So hopefully, these inflation trends will continue.
We'll have to see.
Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we'll announce our September sales results for the 5 weeks ending
Sunday, October 1; on Wednesday, October 4 after the market closes.
With that, I will open it up for Q&A and turn it back over to Lisa. Thank you.

Question and Answer
....................................................................................................................................................................

Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.
Simeon Ari Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
I guess my first question, I don't mean it tongue-in-cheek but is -- I guess, is a membership price
increase part of the fiscal plan? And then part of the question is, is there a point at which this membership
increase is part of, I guess, a hedge against inflation? Is there a point at which model feels more weight
without it? In other words, can you go another year without it?
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
Well, my pat answer, of course, is it's a question of when, not if. It's a little longer this time around since
June of '17, so we're 6 years into it. And -- but you'll see it happen at some point. We can't really tell you
if it's in our plans or not. We'll let you know when we know. We feel good, say, about all the attributes of
member loyalty and member growth.
And frankly, in terms of looking at the values that we provide to our members, we continue to increase
those. It's certainly a greater amount than even -- more than if and when an increase occurs. So stay
tuned. We'll keep you posted. But there's not a whole lot I can tell you about that.
Simeon Ari Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Fair enough. And then ultra short term, as gas prices have moved up, have you seen any effect or impact
on spending at the store?
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
No. I mean, if you look at the numbers over the last few months that we report monthly and quarterly,
there's not been a heck of a lot change. Big ticket discretionary, while improved relatively as I mentioned
online -- those online items, we've seen the number of items in the basket tick up a little in the last few
months, but I think that has more to do with the fact that we consciously added -- I think I mentioned
in the last call, we consciously added 40 or 50, what I'll call, smaller ticket indulgent items, whether it's
snack items and the like to just impulse items. And so that's what we do as merchants. But overall, we
haven't seen any big change or have been able to correlate any big change to what's happened with gas
prices.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Michael Lasser with UBS.
Michael Lasser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Richard, you ended your prepared remarks saying that this quarter or this month, inflation is on pace to
be 1% to 2%, and you suggested it may be even lower than that. So should outside of the reverse, be
prepared for the prospect of deflation either because that's what's happening with some underlying costs
that Costco has been experiencing? Or Costco will look to invest in price as a way to continue to drive
volumes, especially at a time when core-on-core margins are expanding so nicely?

COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL  SEP 26, 2023

Well, first of all, the comment that was 1% to 2% but then as we look at the 17 weeks, if you were -- or
the 4 months roughly, we saw -- if we looked at it internally at each of the end of those 4 months, we saw
the level -- that 1% to 2% is from the beginning to the end of the year -- I'm sorry, the beginning of the
end of the quarter. But during the quarter, we saw that trending downward, if you will, a little. And when I
talk to the merchants, on the fresh side, it's flat to down a little right now on the food and sundries side.
It's up a little, primarily on some of the CPG stuff. And on big ticket -- or not big ticket but on nonfoods,
partly because of freight, which is down year-over-year in a nice way and in some cases, some of the
commodity costs on steel and the like, that's come down. So that being said, not a big change, but at
least it's trending that way. Who knows what tomorrow brings?
And as it relates to us, we're always pushing prices as fast as we can. We want to be the first to lower
them when those things happen and drive sales. I think we've seen that with our traffic.
Michael Lasser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
So just to clarify, what you're saying is food and sundries, prices are down on average year-over-year.
Shelf-stable products are up year-over-year. Gen merch is down. So in totality, it would seem like the
store -- the box is deflating. Does it get -- does the rate at which you see deflation continue to increase
from here? And would you expect that to be just driven by the factors that you mentioned? Or are you
driving that as a way to drive this traffic?
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
Well, first of all, I want to correct one thing that maybe I misstated or you misunderstood. In terms of
fresh, fresh is pretty much flat. Food and sundries, which is everything from sundries and packaged goods
and CPG goods, that tends to be up a little bit. And I'd like to think that we're pushing the envelope as
much as we can with our suppliers, that as certain freight costs have come down, recognizing the headline
today in the paper is oil is approaching $100 a barrel. So who the heck knows what will happen tomorrow?
Michael Lasser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Okay. My follow-up question is, as long as you see big ticket under pressure or discretionary under
pressure, which influences your total sales because it's important for your member to come in and buy
these big ticket items, is this going to influence how you think about managing labor in the store? Should
the market just anticipate that labor and other SG&A is going to delever as long as big ticket's under
pressure?
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
Well, I think we've seen that over the last year, frankly, we had such operating leverage over a couple
of years when we had outside sales during the kind of the 2 years of COVID, call it the spring of '20 to
the spring of 2022. And it was before COVID when our SG&A was over 10%, slightly over 10%, and we
said would it ever be able to get below that. It's now still below 9%. So notwithstanding the fact, when
I've looked at the last several quarters on a year-over-year basis, again, particularly in the last couple of
quarters, we've seen some deleverage of that.
And look, we want to drive sales, and we'll do that in the best ways we can, so -- but we recognize when
we used to -- we used to get the question all the time, what comp number do you need to have 0 negative
or positive leverage with SG&A. Recognizing there was no -- very little inflation back then. But we used
to say somewhere -- who knows but somewhere in the 4.5 to 5 range. So we don't know exactly where it
is, but we're certainly not going to change the level of service that we have. And we're certainly going to
respect our employees in terms of what we've done with wage increases over time. That's what we do.

We'll take our next question from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.
Charles P. Grom
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors
Just sticking on the inflation topic here on unit elasticity, particularly in categories where you're seeing
prices actually start to fall or compress. Curious what you're seeing on units, if you're seeing them
improve at all to offset those price declines, if there's any examples in either food or in GM that you could
talk about.
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
Well, yes, I remember when we talked a few quarters ago about some of the slowness in big ticket
discretionary. When we got hotter on prices, it did a little bit but not as much as we would have thought
to start with. But again, that perhaps was the impact of what's going on with the concerns in the
economy and everything else. We know that when we put hot buys in what we call TBDs, temporary price
discounts, on items, even medium-sized ticket items, we do see the units increase, but there's -- it's not
as predictable, I would say, as it used to be.
Charles P. Grom
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors
Okay. Great. And I think you don't provide guidance, but I -- go ahead.
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
It's a little easier on the food side to see that sometimes when we're taking the price of a meat item down.
Charles P. Grom
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors
Okay. So you are starting to see some units increase as prices drop in certain parts of the business then.
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
Sure. And by the way, even on big ticket, when we've seen $300 and $400 price declines because of
freight and raw material costs on some big ticket nonfood items, we'll see some of the sales picking back
up on that. But it's -- there's nothing guaranteed.
Charles P. Grom
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors
Okay. All right. And I know you don't put out guidance, but I actually do remember when you did give
some directional help back in the day. But are there any big puts and takes that we should be thinking
about on the gross margin and SG&A line over the next 4 quarters that we should be thinking about?
Clearly, the LIFO lap will be an obvious tailwind. But just curious, any other things that we should be
thinking about from a modeling perspective?
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
No, not really. I mean, LIFO is certainly one that was an impact over the last year and starting to --
started to slow down. Assuming that trend continues, there won't be much LIFO going forward for right
now, but we'll see. Beyond that, no, we're still opening. We opened 23 net new units this past year. We're
onboard to do something in the mid- to high 20s this year. But that's not enough to move the needle in
terms of leverage standpoint or anything.
No, I'd say it's steady as she goes. And if anything, I look at the margins overall, given everything that's
going on, including competition that we're doing pretty well there. We -- with some of the wage hikes that

COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL  SEP 26, 2023

we've continued to do and sales being a little weaker than they had been a year ago, I think we're doing
pretty well on that as well. We're optimistic about our future but we'll see what happens.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Peter Benedict with Baird.
Peter Sloan Benedict
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Richard, just first one just on LIFO. I was just curious. I mean the $30 million charge is small, but I'm just
curious why they were even [ to the last one ]. Can you give us a little more color as maybe what drove?
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
Yes. Well, I think it was on things like -- well, gas was one. And then in some of the fresh food items,
there was -- even though there was deflation in things like eggs and some dairy products, there was some
inflationary trends in beef. Beyond that -- do you have that handy?
Unknown Executive
[indiscernible]
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
Yes. It's really small, but on $16 billion of inventory, it's a lot. I mean it's still a small number, $30 million.
I'm not -- but on...
Unknown Executive
[indiscernible]
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
That's all -- I don't have the details beyond that.
Peter Sloan Benedict
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
That's fine. Yes. No, that's fine. Just in the context of broader disinflation and all the stuff, it's interesting
to see that. And then just really turning to the international stuff, you talked about the renewal rates
impact. Can you remind us maybe on the international membership trends? When you open up a new club
outside the U.S., maybe give us some framework or some benchmarks around how many new members
tend to sign up. How does that compare to what you would see, let's say, in the next club you open in
the U.S.? And then what kind of renewal rates you tend to see year 1, year 2, just so we have a frame of
reference there?
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
I don't have the exact numbers in front of me, but generally speaking, in Asia, whether it's Korea, Taiwan,
Japan or China, we'll open a new unit, including the 10 or 12 weeks of sign-ups prior to opening, went
anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 new members. We had a couple of extremes like when we first opened
in Shanghai and Minhang of well over 200,000. Now some of that's looky-loos that don't renew.
And we -- usually in that first year of renewal and those types of outsized numbers, we might be as low
as the mid- to high 50s and is -- and it takes a few years to get even to the mid-70s. But we see those
numbers overall continue to increase every year.

COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL  SEP 26, 2023

And I don't -- I can't -- I don't -- I should probably go back to what it was in the first 10 years of our 40-
year history with even the U.S. My guess, it wasn't that extreme, but we didn't have as many -- it wasn't
national and local news events the day we opened. You had a lot of people coming in, in some of these
markets that are signing up that maybe live too far away or choose not to come back. So we're seeing
that continuing to grow. So even that simple, that slight 0.1% decline, it's around the area in the sense
that if you opened up a couple of more units a year ago, that they were just renewing for the first time,
that increases that number.
Peter Sloan Benedict
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Yes. No, understood. Last question. I think I heard you say mid- to high 20s in terms of unit opening
planned for fiscal '24. Can you give us a sense of how many of those are in the U.S. and then how many
would be international?
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
70-plus percent in the U.S. and Canada, mostly U.S. of course, which, in my view, we're finding more
openings -- more opportunities in the U.S. to infill given our high volumes, and we've got plenty going on
over the years overseas.

We'll take our next question from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.
Erica A Eiler
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division
This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. So I guess, first, I was hoping maybe you could give this a quick
download maybe on how you're feeling about the health of your consumer right now. I mean obviously,
some concerns out there on student loan impact starting to roll in here as those restart. So maybe
any color you can provide on how you're thinking about discretionary from here, maybe some of those
concerns out there? Anything on trade-down or private label? Anything of note on that front in terms of
consumer behavior as well?
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
Right. Well, look, first of all -- first and foremost, our traffic continues to do very well. Being up continually
4% and 5% on a year-over-year basis is great. And our renewal rates continue to be very strong. So
that's a starting point.
It makes sense to us on big-ticket discretionary, that's where you'd see the biggest weakness. We see
some of that in some areas going back. When we look at our numbers compared to MBD that tells us
where we are versus our competitors, overall -- not in every category but overall, we tend to do better.
And so even a negative number here is a lower negative number than elsewhere.
So -- and again, what do we do? We brought in some smaller ticket items that are impulse snack items
to get an extra partial item in everybody's basket. So yes -- and newness, bringing those new items. And
there's not been a whole lot in television. Again, our unit sales in TVs are pretty good, but the average
price point has come down. As they do anyway, there's always deflationary when you don't have new
technology yet, and that's just -- we haven't seen a whole lot of new stuff yet there.

Gaming is good right now. And Christmas is good. I mean we're one of the -- not the only one but one of
the few that are bringing in seasonal items early. Everything from decor to trees to toys, that's starting off
well so far. But it's new. It's in the last few weeks.
Erica A Eiler
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division
Okay, that's really helpful. And then just -- oh, no, go ahead.
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
I'm sorry, what else did you ask?
Erica A Eiler
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division
Yes. And then just shifting gears. So I just wanted to touch on retail media, so obviously, a significant
focus on driving retail media at some of your peers. So just curious if you could maybe talk a little bit
about what Costco is doing in this area and the bigger opportunities that your team sees here.
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
Well, part of that is some of the things we're doing with digital and mobile and the app. And we're not
giving out quantifiable numbers. But certainly, some of our competitors are talking about doubling these
numbers in the next 2 or 3 years. In my view, there's some low-hanging fruit out there, and we're actively
working on it. We've hired a couple of people that are helping us with that as well, and more to come.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Paul Lejuez with Citigroup.
Brandon Babcock Cheatham
Citigroup Inc., Research Division
This is Brandon Cheatham on for Paul. I just wanted to -- when you look at the retail landscape, I was
wondering, how do your wages compare to your competition? Are you seeing similar trends in inflation
pressure on the wage front? And anything that you can help us with what your plans are over the next
couple of quarters?
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
Well, first of all, we've always prided ourselves in providing the best hourly wage package out there,
wages, benefits contributions to 401(k). I'm using U.S. numbers here but our average U.S. -- 90% of our
employees, like many big retailers, are hourly. And our average hourly wage is approaching $26, is in the
high $25s. That's on top of a very rich health care plan where the employee only pays around 11% or
12% of it, I believe, and on top -- a little less than that.
And on top of that, we -- irrespective of what an employee contributes to his or her 401(k), we contribute
anywhere from 3% to 9% based on years of service. So you've got a 20-year cashier making, on a full-
time basis, in the mid-60s with another $4,000 or $5,000 being contributed to his or her 401(k) plan with
a very rich health care plan. So we stand apart in our view compared to anybody.
Our pressure comes from ourselves. In the last few years, as there had been wage pressure, starting with
the frontline workers during the beginnings of COVID, we, like many retailers, added a 2% premium -- $2
premium rather. We kept it longer, to our knowledge, than most anybody for a full year. And at the end,
we kept $1 in there. And since then, we've had at least 3 or 4 increases on top of the normal top-of-scale
increase that we do every -- generally have done every year, we have done every year. So we'll -- in our
view, the pressure comes from us, and we feel that we're way ahead of our competition in that regard.

Brandon Babcock Cheatham
Citigroup Inc., Research Division
Got it. That's helpful. And I think you mentioned the next iteration on the app. You're going to be able to
scan barcodes. Is the idea that eventually the customer is going to be able to scan and go? And how could
that help flow operations in your stores if that is the case?
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
I don't think we're prepared for scan and go yet. We'll just go to scan, but they can't go. No, at the end of
the day, the first order of business is getting the merchandise on there and have numbers that -- where a
member even goes online and say, "Hey, you can also get this currently at your local location." So knowing
what's in store when somebody wants to come out, I think that's going to be a big positive to start with.
And part of the scan is to be able to get more product information on the item as well.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Greg Melich with Evercore.
Gregory Scott Melich
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division
I had 2 questions, Richard. First, I'd love an update, given the volatility in gas prices the last 1.5 years, as
to where we are on penny profit. I know that it improved a lot, but I'm curious if it came back down in the
last 12 months or if it sort of stabilized at that higher level.
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
Well, we don't give specific numbers. Gas has been stronger for us and we believe all retailers in the last
few years. In fact, it was Q4 last year, which I think was our strongest quarter, recognizing it's a 16-week
quarter. This fourth quarter, it was still strong, down from its strongest year earlier on a weekly basis but
nonetheless quite strong. And so it's part of the profit picture currently of all big retailers that sell gas, the
supermarkets, the Walmarts, the Costcos of the world.
So it's still a profitable business. It's -- our view has been it used to be when prices -- given that we turn
it so fast, literally almost daily, when profits are going up -- and I'm sorry, when the price of gas is going
up, the guy down the street who's turning it every 8 or 9 days is paying a little less 4 days ago. And so we
make a little less and we -- when sales went down -- gallons -- the price per gallon went down. We made
a little more. I think that equation, while it's still true, is not the driver of the bottom line of gas.
Everybody seems to be wanting to make more in gas, which allows us, in our view, to make it a little
more and still be even more profitable. We've seen our competitive spread versus our direct competitors
at every location, on average, improve over the last couple of years to now be in the, I want to say, the
$0.30 range per gallon, mid-30s is the average, which is up. It's an average and it can range from $0.10
to $0.45. But at the end of the day, we feel good about our competitive position. It's increased and we're
still quite profitable, down a little bit from a year ago but nonetheless, quite profitable.
Gregory Scott Melich
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division
That's helpful. And then my follow-up is on cash. I think you finished it with $13.7 billion. I think the last
time you got to $13 billion was when you had a special dividend in 2020. What are your thoughts on how
much cash you need or want and especially now that there is a positive interest rate on holding cash?
Does that make you more interested in keeping it, but then you pay more tax? Just how do you think
about...
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 12



COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL  SEP 26, 2023

Well, I think it's -- look, at the end of the day, we've done 4 special dividends in the past. It's part of our
DNA. At some point, we may do that again. Again, it's somewhat like the answer to the other question
about membership fees. It's probably a question of when, not if, but we'll let you know.
Certainly, with earning 5%-ish on that money instead of a [ 25%-ish ] on that money does make it a little
harder to do. But we're not selling at the kind of earnings multiple. We are to earn 5% on our assets. So
at some point, we'll do something, and we'll have to wait and see.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets.
Kelly Ann Bania
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research
Richard, just wanted to ask -- I think I've asked this many, many times, but it seems like another huge
quarter for Executive Membership growth, almost 1 million more this quarter. And I was just curious if
you could talk about the profile of that member today that's either upgrading or starting out as Executive.
What's the characteristics of that customer? And any changes in how that Executive Member spend in their
first year in that upgrade compared to the prior years?
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
I was joking when I say, first of all, they're very smart to be an Executive Member. Look, I think we -- over
the time, we've done a better job of communicating the value of the Executive Member, so we clearly get
more people to sign up that way in advance. And we see that, over time, a regular member, over the first
few years, will buy more every year. An Executive Member starts at a higher lever and will buy more every
year from that higher level. So that's really the profile that we've seen.
I don't have any specifics on how old the member is. I know that when we look at age characteristics
of new members, we're still -- everybody used to be concerned 10 years ago how are we going to get
millennials when we have an older average customer and all that. And we did with things -- with items,
with things like organic. We're doing the same thing now. We're still getting our -- whether it's Gen Z or
Gen A or whatever the next gen is, we are getting our share of those new numbers when we look at the
profile of our members.
Kelly Ann Bania
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research
And Richard, I might have missed this. But did you quantify the extra week impact in terms of EBIT or EPS
or anything for us?
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
No. It's -- I mean, the simple math would just say it's [ 16, 17 ] of our quarter is equal to a 16-week
quarter. That's about as good as we could do. But in case that -- usually on net income, it takes the 16 or
whatever percent number down to a 9 or something, and that's just simple math.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Oliver Chen with TD Cowen.
Oliver Chen
TD Cowen, Research Division
Richard, inventory seemed well positioned. What are your thoughts about where they are now and also
how we will model them going forward relative to sales? And then as we look at overall ticket trends being
negative, that compare starts to ease. So does that imply that will inflect on partly the nature of the ticket
comparisons overall.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 13



COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL  SEP 26, 2023

The same question for e-commerce. As you anniversary some of the headwinds, can we expect the
comparison to help as well?
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
Sure. Inventories, as I mentioned, we feel the merchants feel very good about our inventory levels right
now. There are a few departments a little higher than they want, a few that did a little bit more [ sure ].
But overall, they're very good.
In fact, you look at -- our fiscal year-end inventory stood at just under $16.7 billion and payables stood
at $17.5 billion. So I think this is the -- running above 100% on that simple ratio is something new. We
used to be -- we used to enjoy running 90% to 95%. It fluctuates. But overall, we feel good about our
inventories where they are now.
And in terms of supply chain, things coming in on time, we feel good about that as well. Now as it relates
to -- as we anniversary the inflection of when we saw some weakness, I think a couple of quarters ago,
I mentioned that, well, what will help your big ticket sales. I said, well, at least in a few -- several more
months, we'll anniversary this weakness.
So certainly, that's going to help. I would like to think that it's not just that thing that's going to help, but
-- and the same with e-commerce. I mean we're, again, one bright spot in this virtually all e-commerce --
not nearly all e-commerce, was the appliances that -- and I think we've done a better job also of showing
the value of these items online, not just the price of the item, which, in our case, includes delivery and
warranty and things like that more so than some of our competitors and showing great value there.
Oliver Chen
TD Cowen, Research Division
Just a couple of short ones. Would love any thoughts on Instacart. It seems like it's a really great
partnership that you've had for a while. Also another question we had is will EV charging play a role in how
you're thinking about future services for customers. Finally, China, any -- it's a smaller percentage of total,
but it's an important market for the long term. What's happening there? Has anything changed the value
proposition or the geopolitics?
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
Okay. Yes, I had the second and third. What was the first question?
Unknown Executive
Instacart.
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
Instacart. I know they just went public, so we've gotten a lot of questions. At the end of the day, they're
good -- we're a good partner with them. They're a good partner for us. We use them throughout the U.S.
and Canada. And sales are growing. We've added over the last -- during COVID, we added some nonfood
items that still can be carried in the car if you will. And we're doing, I think, prescriptions with them now.
And so no, it's a good relationship and has been for a while.
Yes. I might add, though, that with regard to those sales, we include that in our warehouse sales, not our
e-commerce sales because it's their employee coming into Costco to shop, to purchase at the register and
then take it to the customer. So that's not in our mobile or e-commerce sales.
As it relates to EV charging, we're testing it in a number of locations. Not a whole lot to be said. If there's
a charge for it, it's going to be less at Costco. And we'll wait and see.

And then as it relates to China, no, we just opened a few weeks ago our fifth location. We have 2 more
planned this fiscal year, both in the -- I think 1 in Shenzhen in early calendar '24 and 1 other 1 before
the end of August, so we'll have 7 locations up from 2 1.5 years ago. And so far, our openings there have
treated us well overall.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist.
Scot Ciccarelli
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division
Can you help us understand a bit better how the Costco Next process works? I mean is it similar to
how your e-commerce business used to work where products were essentially drop-shipped from their
vendors? And if that's the case, Richard, how do you control the quality of the product and delivery
process? Because I thought that became an issue for you guys before you took over your own distribution
for e-com.
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
Yes. Costco Next is drop-shipped. We curate the items with these suppliers. And they're, for the most part,
pretty well-known brands. And so far, we have not had an issue on that, recognizing they tend to be items
that are easily shipped to a home. Yes, and we're doing -- we have all the tracking information as well.
So all I can tell you is you're right about that. That's a good point. Years ago when we did this, there was
a difference. But so far, it's worked quite well for us. We've had very few customer issues as it relates to
items purchased on costco.com or costconext.com.
Scot Ciccarelli
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division
Okay. Understood. And then another inflation question. If we do wind up getting outright deflation, outside
of improved traffic or unit velocity, are there ways to protect margin? Because it seems to me like that
could wind up being a deflator to the margin if we're in a deflationary environment there.
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
Well, look, that's what our business is about. We're -- we'll take a 10 pack and make it a 12 pack, I guess.
But at the end of the day, if there's a little disinflation, it'll impact all of us. But again, I think it should be
favorable with us because we'll show the best -- we'll still show the best value out there.
Operator
We'll take our next question...
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
Before you do, another comment was made at the table here that if there is deflation or disinflation, we've
got a $450 million, $500 million LIFO reserve that will be -- on a reported basis, will be part of a tailwind
of that disinflation.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital.

COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL  SEP 26, 2023

I don't think we've talked about it. But what's competition like out there now that we're seeing inflation
come down in volumes, particularly for some guys are on a negative? Just wondering if you -- what it
looks like out there.
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
I think, look, we've said this for a few years now, our competition with Sam's is the most direct, and we've
seen improvements in parts of what they do from our perspective. They're tough competitors and so are
we. And -- but I think they've continued to get -- to improve over time and as have we. I don't -- we don't
really see a whole lot of other things.
BJ's, while we respect their model and what they do, it's a slightly different model, so there's not as much
-- there's certainly -- when we are competing directly as a membership warehouse club, we're making
sure we're sharp on pricing, particularly in fresh and things like that, supermarket items. Beyond that,
yes, our view is on the nonfood side, we're gaining share, as evidenced by the numbers we see in some
of these NPD results and the thing that I just called out on appliances and things like that, recognizing
appliances is a, whatever, a $30 billion business. We're still a small piece of it but growing rapidly.
Scott Andrew Mushkin
R5 Capital LLC
And then I know it came up earlier about raising membership rates but kind of philosophical, like this
recession, not recession, maybe there will be one. How does the company look at raising the membership
fee if the economy is slow and fast? Does it matter? Does it factor in?
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
I think it matters -- it does matter. And I think it really mattered as we approached kind of the 5.5 years
post June '17, we were in the high -- the headline every day was inflation and economy. And so we're
doing great. We've got great loyalty. If we wait a little longer, so be it. And that's kind of how we feel right
now.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.
Christopher Michael Horvers
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
So your core-on-core margins were up a lot in this quarter. Can you talk about what drove that? I think
you mentioned food and sundries. Is that successful vendor-funded promotions? Is there anything onetime
in nature about that gain that we shouldn't extrapolate forward?
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
Yes. Well, aside from LIFO, markdowns were a lot less, I think -- quarter-on-quarter. So no markdowns
was a big piece of it. Particularly on the nonfood side, that helped. Last year, we had -- it was a year
ago that all of us, including Costco, I think our inventories on a year-over-year basis were up 26% for 2
quarters in a row. And of course, those have all come down. And so that was probably the biggest single
thing in those numbers.
Yes. A comment that was made at the table here, we're back on track on seasonal in and out dates. So
we're not having -- a year -- it was a year, 1.5 years ago where certain seasonal items came in late. And
just to move them out, not to have to store them as much -- some we did store but to move them out
where we thought was the best way to do it, we took extra markdowns. So that helped.

And then a follow-up question around the consumer. You just came through the back-to-school season.
There are some important electronics categories that are a big part of the basket during that time of
the year that also become a big part of the basket around holiday. Are you seeing iPads and PCs and
notebooks, are you seeing positive unit trends? And how does it make you feel about the upcoming
holiday season?
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
Gaming is up. Some of the Apple products are up. TV units are up but again, the average price points have
come down some. Tablets are up and audio is up a little.
Christopher Michael Horvers
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
But not notebooks and computers?
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
No. Less down was the answer, yes.
Operator
We'll take our next question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim.
John Edward Heinbockel
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division
So Richard, first thing, maybe just talk about how you look at cannibalization versus expanding the market
in the U.S., right? And if you -- obviously, you can now put, it looks like, locations closer together. When
you kind of look at the U.S. in total, is there a number, right, that you guys have in mind that's now
possible given what you're doing with density?
Unknown Executive
We could add another 150.
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
Yes. Yes. Our view is over the next 10 years that we could add easily another 150, and that's on top of
however many business centers, call it, but just in the U.S. And that number keeps changing. If you had
asked me 6, 8 years ago where we'd be today, I would say if we were 70-30 U.S. back then, we'd be
50-50 by now outside of the -- will be 50. And today, we're at 65, 70 in the U.S. still. So we're finding
more opportunities here.
And it's evidenced by just the sheer volumes of the units that our units are doing today versus 3 or 4
years ago. It's much higher than we would have expected 3 or 4 years ago. So we think that there's still a
lot of runway in that regard.
John Edward Heinbockel
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division
And then just a quick follow-up. The -- I know you guys haven't been particularly interested in BOPIS,
right, for cost reasons. And I assume that's still the case. There's a consumer argument for it, but I think
it's hard to make the cost side of it work. Is that still your view?

That is still our view overall. In addition to the thing I mentioned a little bit with what we're doing with
Instacart on some nonfood items as well, we are testing in-store some big-ticket items like TVs but on a
limited basis to see what happens for buy online and pick up in store.
Operator
We'll take our last question from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group.
Joseph Isaac Feldman
Telsey Advisory Group LLC
I wanted to ask about, the CPG guys, are they funding promotions a little more regularly with you guys? I
know you did something, I think, with P&G that seemed like a clever promotion, get a gift card back from
them, it seemed. And I'm just wondering what you're seeing across the other vendors.
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
Yes. Well, the CGP, actually, we did that last year as well. We've done it for a couple of years, and we
will say if we did it again. It's growing. So yes. And once we do that with one, we want to share that
excitement with others to see what other types of things we can drive that way. So yes, I'd say there's
probably a little bit more increase on that type of promotional things and inventory available for those
things because we can really drive sales of those items in a short period of time.
Joseph Isaac Feldman
Telsey Advisory Group LLC
Right. That makes sense, yes, the volume that you guys do. And then are you guys approaching holiday
any different this year? I know you mentioned Christmas goods are off to a good start. But is that earlier
than normal? I feel like you're about the same timing, but maybe you could share thoughts on the
approach to the holiday season.
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
If it's earlier, it's a week or 2 earlier and some things came in early and...
Unknown Executive
[indiscernible]
Richard A. Galanti
Executive VP, CFO & Director
Yes, yes. It's a little early compared to some of the supply chain disruptions we had, which screwed up a
lot of things. But if you go back to where we were before COVID, we're probably at or very slightly earlier.
And in terms of how we're approaching it, we're approaching it aggressively in terms of having stuff to sell
to the member. But we want to be out, too.
Typically, this is nothing different here. Even on things like toys, we'll bring in a few things in the last
couple of weeks before Christmas, that if they don't sell through, we're not at risk of having to mark them
down dramatically because they're not unique just to Christmas.
Well, thank you, everyone. We're around to answer questions. And have a good holiday, and we'll talk to
you soon.

That does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.
