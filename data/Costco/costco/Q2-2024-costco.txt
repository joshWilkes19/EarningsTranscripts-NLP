COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 30, 2024

Presentation
....................................................................................................................................................................

Operator
Thank you for standing by. My name is Krista, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time,
I would like to welcome everyone to the Costco Wholesale Corporation Third Quarter 2024 Earnings
Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]
I will now turn the conference over to Gary Millerchip, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Gary, you may begin your conference.
Gary Millerchip
Executive VP & CFO
Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining the call today.
I'd like to start by saying how excited I am to be part of the Costco team, and it's a pleasure to be hosting
my first Costco quarterly conference call.
The whole Costco team has been incredibly welcoming. And as you might imagine, my first 3 months
working alongside Richard have been a lot of fun. It's also been great visiting warehouses and facilities
to immerse myself in the Costco culture and experience firsthand how this is positioning the company for
continued growth.
Over recent months, I've spent time and met with many analysts and investors, several of whom I know
through my prior role. And it's clear you value and appreciate the company's current approach to investor
communications. While I can't promise to be able to match the humor that Richard Galanti had become
famous for, I can promise the same level of open dialogue and transparency you've come to expect. Oh,
and to clear up some recent media speculation, I also want to confirm the $1.50 hot dog price is safe.
Before I talk about our results, I wanted to mention that Ron Vachris is also joining today's call. Many of
you have expressed interest in hearing from Ron, and so we thought it would be a good idea to have Ron
join the discussion, and he can also take a few questions.
Ron, would you like to add anything before we talk about the quarter?
Ron M. Vachris
President, CEO & Director
Thank you, Gary. And again, welcome to Costco. I'm very happy to report that the transition from Richard
to Gary has gone very well, and we're very excited to have Gary onboard as part of Costco, and I look
forward to working together on the growth opportunities ahead for our company.
Before we jump into the quarter, I wanted to make a couple of comments on the leadership transition. As
Richard has mentioned on previous calls, I've worked closely with Craig Jelinek for many years, including
side-by-side for the last 2 years as President. And so the CEO transition has been a very seamless
process. Since January, my time has been focused on working closely with the teams around the world to
ensure we continue to deliver the best quality merchandise that are best value for our members.
I'm incredibly proud of our employees, and I believe our consistency of the results is a reflection of their
commitment to our members and to each other.
Consistent with how Craig and Richard managed investor communications, I intend to have Gary host the
quarterly conference calls, and I will join, as business permits, to answer a few questions.
So Gary, let's go to the results, and I'm happy to jump back in for the Q&A portion to field some questions
today.

COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 30, 2024

Thanks, Ron.
I'll start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that
may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such
statements. The risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as
well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with
the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the company does not
undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. Comparable sales and comparable sales
excluding impacts from changes in gasoline prices and foreign exchange are intended as supplemental
information and are not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP.
In today's press release, we reported operating results for the third quarter of fiscal '24, the 12 weeks
ended May 12.
Before I walk through all the numbers, new for this quarter, we are making available a slide presentation
on our investor site under Events & Presentations. These slides summarize much of the information I will
share today, including Richard's famous matrices. We intend to make this information available every
quarter.
Reported net income for the third quarter came in at $1.68 billion or $3.78 per diluted share, up from
$1.3 billion and $2.93 per diluted share in the third quarter last year. Last year's results included a
nonrecurring charge to merchandise costs of $298 million pretax or $0.50 per diluted share, primarily for
the discontinuation of our charter shipping activities.
Net sales for the third quarter were $57.39 billion, an increase of 9.1% from $52.6 billion in the third
quarter last year. The following comparable sales reflect comparable locations year-over-year and
comparable retail weeks.
U.S. comp sales were 6.2% or 6% adjusted for gas inflation and FX. Canada was 7.7% or 7.4% adjusted.
Other International was 7.7% or 8.5% adjusted. And this led to total company comp sales of 6.6% or
6.5% adjusted for gas inflation and FX. Finally, e-commerce comp sales were 20.7%, both on a reported
basis and adjusted for foreign exchange.
In terms of Q3 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 6.1% worldwide and 5.5%
in the U.S. Our average transaction or ticket was up 0.5% worldwide and up 0.7% in the U.S. Foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 20 basis points while
gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 30 basis points.
Moving down the income statement to membership fee income. We reported membership fee income of
$1.123 billion, an increase of $79 million or 7.6% year-over-year. Membership fee income growth was 8%,
excluding FX.
In terms of renewal rates, at Q3 end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate was 93%, up 0.1% from Q2 end.
The worldwide rate came in at 90.5%, the same as Q2 end.
We ended Q3 with 74.5 million paid household members, up 7.8% versus last year; and 133.9 million
cardholders, up 7.4% year-over-year. At Q3 end, we had 34.5 million paid executive memberships, an
increase of 661,000 since Q2 end. Executive members now represent over 46% of paid members and
73.1% of worldwide sales.
Our reported gross margin rate in the third quarter was higher year-over-year by 52 basis points, coming
in at 10.84% compared to 10.32% last year, and up 54 basis points excluding gas inflation.
Core was flat and higher by 2 basis points without gas inflation. In terms of core margin on their own
sales, our core-on-core margins were higher by 10 basis points.
Ancillary and other businesses gross margin was lower 6 basis points and lower 5 basis points excluding
gas inflation. This decrease year-over-year was driven by gas, partially offset by e-commerce.

COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 30, 2024

2% Reward was lower by 1 basis point both with and without gas inflation, with higher sales penetration
coming from our executive members.
LIFO was a benefit of 2 basis points. We had an $11 million LIFO credit in Q3 this year compared to no
LIFO charge or credit in Q3 last year. This is the third LIFO credit this year following a $15 million LIFO
credit in Q1 and a $14 million credit in Q2.
And finally, Other was higher 57 basis points or 56 basis points excluding gas inflation. This was all related
to lapping last year's negative impact from the $298 million pretax charge for charter shipping activities.
Moving on to SG&A. Our reported SG&A rate in the third quarter was lower or better year-over-year by
15 basis points, coming in this year at 8.96% compared to last year's 9.11%. SG&A was lower year-over-
year by 12 basis points adjusted for gas inflation. The operations component of SG&A was lower by 14
basis points and lower by 12 basis points excluding the impact from gas inflation, despite an increase in
warehouse wages this year. Higher labor productivity and great cost discipline by our operators drove the
improved core SG&A results for the quarter.
Central was better by 1 basis point and flat without gas inflation, and stock compensation and preopening
were both flat year-over-year.
Below the operating income line, interest expense was $41 million this year versus $36 million last year.
And interest income and other for the quarter was flat year-over-year as lower interest income was
offset by a foreign exchange gain in the quarter. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in Q3 was 26.4%
compared to 26.5% in Q3 last year.
Overall, reported net income was up 29.1% year-over-year. And excluding last year's charge related to the
discontinuation of charter shipping activities, it was up 10.3% year-over-year.
A few other items of note. In terms of warehouse expansion, in the third quarter, we opened 2 new
warehouses, both in the U.S. Additionally, since the end of Q3, we had 2 more openings. Last week, we
opened in Loomis, California. And 2 days ago, we opened our seventh building in China in the Nanjing
market. For the remainder of fiscal '24, we plan to open another 12 new locations: 9 in the U.S., 2 in
Japan and 1 in Korea. This would bring the total for the full year to 30 openings, including 1 relocation for
a net of 29 new warehouses.
Regarding capital expenditures, Q3 spend was approximately $1.06 billion, and we estimate full year '24
capital expenditure will be between $4.3 billion and $4.5 billion.
Diving a bit deeper into some of the key themes we saw during the quarter. Nonfoods have the highest
comps of our core categories. This strength was aided by lapping some softness in sales a year ago but
was really driven by our merchandising teams doing a great job identifying high-quality items with values
that really resonated with our members and buying those items with conviction.
As inflation has leveled off, our members are returning to purchasing more discretionary items and growth
in the category was led by toys, tires, lawn & garden and health and beauty aids.
Bakery sales also showed great momentum in the quarter as our fresh foods team has reinvented that
department with a number of new and exciting items, including the Kirkland Signature Lemon Blueberry
Loaf and Morning Buns.
Within our ancillary businesses, the food court had the strongest quarterly sales, with continued success of
the chocolate chip cookie that was added to the food court this year.
On the inflation front, it's more of the same from last quarter. Across all core merchandise, inflation was
essentially flat in Q3, with fresh foods close to 0 and slight inflation in food and sundries being offset by
some deflation in nonfoods. The deflation in nonfoods was led by hardware, sporting goods and furniture,
all still benefiting from lower freight costs year-over-year. Keep in mind that when we speak to inflation or,
in the case of nonfoods deflation, we're referring to our selling prices.

COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 30, 2024

We're intentionally creating incremental value for our members by delivering lower prices wherever
possible. We believe our strategy of delivering value to drive unit volume and member satisfaction is the
winning combination for us. In that vein, our buying teams are constantly aware of changing costs across
all of their SKUs and are ensuring that we are capturing all cost decreases quickly so that we can pass
on incremental value through price reductions. If we are unsuccessful in delivering ultimate value with
branded goods, we evaluate the potential for new high-quality Kirkland Signature items with a goal of
providing at least 20% value versus what we would sell the national brand item at.
This quarter, we released a new Kirkland Signature men's walking shoe and new Kirkland Signature facial
wipes, both of which are doing very well.
We also reduced prices on a number of existing items, including lowering Kirkland Signature pine nuts
from $29.99 to $24.99 and reducing the price of our Kirkland Signature frozen shrimp SKUs by $1. These
are just a couple of examples that came out of our recent monthly budget meetings where each country
and region shared new and exciting items they have introduced to their warehouses and items where
they've lowered prices.
Turning now to digital. We continue to make enhancements to the app and website and are excited about
the traction that these initiatives are getting with members. Total e-commerce sales growth in the quarter
was led by gold and silver bullion, gift cards and appliances.
In appliances, Costco Logistics is playing a key role in providing both greater value and a better end-to-
end experience for members. Deliveries through Costco Logistics were up 28% in the quarter. Costco
Next, our curated marketplace, also continues to grow nicely, and we added 8 new vendors in Q3, bringing
the total to $75 million.
Our app downloads were up 32% versus a year ago with about 2.5 million new downloads in the quarter,
bringing total downloads to more than 35 million. Site traffic was up 16% and average order value was up
8%.
You may have also recently seen an announcement that we are expanding our relationship with Uber.
Previously, Uber Eats delivered Costco orders in Texas, and this new agreement allows consumers the
ability to order from Costco through Uber Eats across all of Canada as well as 17 states in the U.S. We are
also working to expand this partnership to several of our international countries in the coming months. In
addition to the increased access to Uber's customers, the agreement will allow us to sell Uber gift cards
globally and offer discounted Uber One annual membership to Costco members.
Finally, in terms of our upcoming releases, we will announce our May sales results for the 4 weeks ending
Sunday, June 2, on Wednesday, June 5, after market close. Also, remember that our fiscal fourth quarter
ending September 1, 2024, will have 16 weeks versus the 17 weeks in the fiscal fourth quarter last year.
And with that, we will now open it up for Q&A.

Question and Answer
....................................................................................................................................................................

Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.
Simeon Ari Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
I'm going to take a stab at this membership question. The way that we've thought about it is it's an
inflation offset to the model. And it was described as if you have enough levers in the middle of the P&L to
deliver whatever stated EBIT growth you're trying to do, you didn't need to touch the membership fee. Is
that still the way that you look at it? And is that visibility on enough levers still intact?
Gary Millerchip
Executive VP & CFO
Yes. Thanks, Simeon. And you're talking about membership fee increase now, is that where your question
was coming from?
Simeon Ari Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Correct. Yes.
Gary Millerchip
Executive VP & CFO
Yes. I would really kind of revert back to some of the comments that Richard shared previously. I don't
think that we're thinking about it any differently than he's talked about in the last few calls. We've
historically looked at increasing the membership fee every 5 years or so. And obviously, we're beyond
that time period now in terms of what will be the typical cycle. There's nothing about anything that we
see within how the business is performing that's changing our view on that. We feel really good about
membership renewal rates. We feel really good about the test of are we delivering significantly more value
to members than we were or have since we last increased the membership fee.
But I think we are our own, probably, toughest competitor and that we look at what's happened in
the marketplace over the last few years, and when we were seeing high inflation and the risk and
concern around recession. I know before I joined the company, it was talked about extensively, and it
continues to be talked about as something that is still a case of when we increase the fee rather than if
we increase the fee. But we're still evaluating those considerations to determine what the right timing is.
And when we reach that point where we feel it is the right time, of course, we'll be very open and direct in
communicating that.
Simeon Ari Gutman
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Okay. Fair enough. Can I ask about your opinion on the U.S. expansion? It's been holding in a lot better,
it's been more giving than we would have thought several years ago. Do you have any thoughts, just your
own perspective? You're probably looking at members per warehouse. Are you surprised at the runway
you still have in the U.S.? Do you think it could be even more than what we're aware of today, less? Just
curious if there's anything surprising on that item.
Gary Millerchip
Executive VP & CFO
I think it's only surprising in as much as -- I know we've talked previously about we thought that we
would potentially run out of runway for new warehouses in the U.S. and, as you know, this year, we're
opening close to 29 net new warehouses and many of those will be continuing in the U.S., and we still see

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 7



COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 30, 2024

significant runway to continue to opening more warehouses in the U.S. in the future. I think that sort of
25 to 30 new warehouse count is a reasonable proxy for what we think the runway is for the foreseeable
future for new warehouses. And I'd be surprised if at least half of those won't continue to be in the U.S.
because we still see significant growth when we open those new warehouses.
And what it's doing for us in filling the market is it's creating capacity for our members that are shopping
very busy warehouses today to be able to shop more frequently and drive more engagement with us. And
also, it increases membership renewal rates over time as well. So I think we still see plenty of runway in
the U.S. to continue to open more warehouses, but we also see a lot of growth opportunity, of course, in
the international markets as well.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.
Michael Lasser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
There's been a lot of announcements from consumable retailers in recent times about making price
investments. Do you think you need to make a sizable price investment in the next couple of quarters in
order to remain competitive?
Ron M. Vachris
President, CEO & Director
This is Ron Vachris. No, I think that this is part of our everyday DNA. I mean we are competitive on a daily
basis. Our buyers are on top of pricing daily, weekly, and we all review them each month. And so we feel
very good about where we are today and our runway to continue to be as competitive as we are moving
forward.
Michael Lasser
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
And my follow-up question is, given some of the changes in leadership over the last year or so, is there
any thought given to being more aggressive with some of the evolution on the model, things like buy
online, pick up in store, deploying more technology in the store or capitalizing on the ever so great
amount of data that Costco has in the form of trying to monetize it through retail media?
Ron M. Vachris
President, CEO & Director
I think the answer to that is yes on all those fronts. We are working on all those aspects right now. We're
rolling out an expanded buy online, pick up in warehouse that is always going to be limited in scope based
on the volume in our warehouses that we have, we can't expand to all categories. But we're expanding as
we currently speak, in televisions and other electronic items that are there. And so yes, we see that as a
real opportunity for us.
Technology is going to be one of our key priorities moving forward, how do we improve that member
engagement and the relationship we have with them in our brick-and-mortar warehouses as well as online
and through other aspects such as travel and so forth. So technology we see as a great opportunity to
enhance the member relationship with Costco and also drive a lot more business for us as well as we
move forward.
So we're going to continually innovate. I mean with the management changes, I wouldn't expect major
changes as we have a proven strategy now. But as we've done for the past 41 years, we continue to
innovate to the needs of our members.
And the last, on data, absolutely, we see a great opportunity for data. We have expanded our group there.
We have a significant program now with retail media. And we see some great upside potential. We've

COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 30, 2024

expanded that team, and we see some good potential and some good runway for us in that as well, things
like personalization and so forth.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.
Charles P. Grom
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors
Congrats again, Gary. Historically, Richard and team have been steadfast on the 14% to 15% margin
ceiling, which has clearly paid dividends for the company over the years. I'm curious how you and Ron
view this threshold. Are you going to adhere to it? Do you think you're going to earn more? Just your
thoughts on the margin front.
Ron M. Vachris
President, CEO & Director
No, that 14%, 15% has been part of our life for many years. And so I think our objective, our buyers'
goals is really how aggressive they can get on pricing and deliver the best value. So I don't see -- there's
no plans to move that capital.
Gary Millerchip
Executive VP & CFO
And Chuck, maybe just one thing to build on that, too. I think as you think about some of the
opportunities that Ron mentioned on the earlier call, I completely echo Ron's comment about we have
a really clear growth strategy that's obviously delivering momentum in the company today. And these
opportunities through technology and media I think are great opportunities for us to find new ways to
unlock value. But again, I think we see those very much in the mindset of how do we give 90%-ish of that
back to the members so that we're continuing to drive member engagement, member loyalty and member
value.
Charles P. Grom
Gordon Haskett Research Advisors
Okay. Great. And then just to kind of build off Michael's question, just wanted to get your high-level
thoughts on digital e-com. What do you think Costco's strengths are? What do you think the weaknesses
are today? And where do you think the biggest focus is going to be for the company in the coming years?
Ron M. Vachris
President, CEO & Director
Our biggest strength on digital e-com is, of course, the merchandise and the value that we have. I mean
that's what works for us in our brick-and-mortar. The technology, the systems that we have, the teams
have got a great road map of where they're going. A lot of the work that's being done right now is very
foundational. So better fulfillment, quicker delivery times reliability of the site, those type of things. So
those are the things. And then following that will come iterative changes of forward-facing improvements
that you'll see in the sites and move forward. So I think we've got a very good road map to do that.
But I think personalization is a big deal for members that we could do a much better job on and also
a better correlation of the warehouse and the online business. We're working towards warehouse
inventory online. Some members could use that on the app. But app functionality is one of our greatest
opportunities.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities.
Scot Ciccarelli
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 9



COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 30, 2024

So given the strength of your discretionary sales following the level that we've seen as the economy got a
little funky, does that suggest your members are starting to feel better and more willing to spend on wants
rather than needs?
Ron M. Vachris
President, CEO & Director
It does indeed look that way. I've got to tell you that the discretionary spend we're seeing, I mean
we're definitely winning in consumables as we see the food business and dining away from home has
softened up a bit and people are eating and we're seeing that in our fresh foods, but I have to tell you that
categories such as the home division and toys are categories that have lagged quite a bit post-COVID that,
with great excitement, I mean our buyers have come out and delivered some great items at phenomenal
values and really rejuvenated those categories. And those are both leading categories for us. And sporting
goods, toys, furnishings, domestics, all those categories are really coming on very strong now and all of a
discretionary nature.
Scot Ciccarelli
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division
Fascinating. And then today, we had a presentation, obviously, Ron, you joined the call. Are there other
changes we could potentially expect given some of the C-suite changes?
Ron M. Vachris
President, CEO & Director
I mean, again, like I said, there's no major changes planned. The team is the team that's been running
this company for some time. Gary has been a great addition to us and is contributing nicely. But our model
is working. It's working around the world. Great value on quality merchandise seems to resonate in every
region that we do business. So we'll continue to innovate. We'll continue to see new things and be relative
to what our members' needs are. But I can't sit here today and tell you to expect any great momentous
changes in the near future. We just want to continue to execute well.
Gary Millerchip
Executive VP & CFO
And Scot, maybe just to add from my perspective of being new to the role and new to the company, early
observations for me, obviously, incredibly impressed with the culture and the strategy. It's clearly working
very well. So my first priority, being new to the company, is to really acclimatize and to support and
enable a smooth transition with the culture to make sure the momentum that we have continues going
forward.
And I think the other point, as we talked about a little bit earlier on the call, is we're on a journey with
technology and data. And so hopefully, there's things that I can bring to work with the team and help us
continuing on that journey and accelerate that journey. And really, that's the priorities in my mind being
new into the CFO role.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets.
Kelly Ann Bania
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research
Love the slides. I wanted to just maybe go back a little bit to retail media strategy and personalization.
I think, Ron, you noted a hire or maybe some key hires in that department. And Gary, I think you
bring a unique perspective to this area or both of these areas. So I guess just can you help size up the
opportunity for us on these two fronts, in retail media and personalization? Is it at all different than a
typical retailer because of Costco's unique model and SKU count or anything along those lines? And I
guess, would your plans in these areas include any increase in technology spend in coming years?

COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 30, 2024

Gary Millerchip
Executive VP & CFO
Sure. Thanks, Kelly. Yes, I'll go first, and then Ron may want to add some color as well. I think many of
your comments are relevant to how we think about the opportunity. The first thing, I guess I would say
as being new and having joined the company is, as you think about where a lot of companies talk about
alternative profit streams, there are a lot of areas today where Costco is doing great things in that area
today. So using the strength of the membership relationship in driving a very large co-brand payment
program that delivers value to members and delivers values to the company; the travel services business
that we have, which is pretty unique in retail, but I think in any other company would be viewed as a way
of generating new revenue and alternative revenue streams from sort of expanding from that overall retail
relationship; and then thirdly, I would say we have media revenue today in areas of the business.
So it's not as though it isn't something that actually the business is delivering on today. But I think as Ron
mentioned in an earlier comment that, as technology and data are something that we're sort of building a
path towards, I would still say there's significant opportunity for us to grow in that space because of the
unique nature of the relationship we have with our members and the ways in which we can deliver value
for them and tap into that data and tap into the growth that we're creating, both in the warehouse and
through digital channels.
I think it's a little bit early to sort of size it in totality because, you're right, there are also some unique
elements about our model that would make our opportunity a little bit different. But from what we know
today and from the team that's been brought in to help the company think through it, we certainly believe
it's got significant runway to drive a lot of growth for the company. And as I mentioned earlier though, I
would definitely think of it as something that we'll look at too, as we do with everything, reinvest in the
member to really accelerate the growth of the company overall.
Ron M. Vachris
President, CEO & Director
I would have to mirror what Gary says. We do have a unique model. We have a relationship with all of our
members. Our responsibility is use that data wisely and respectfully. As far as IT spend, yes, there will
be some IT spend. As we look in the future, we don't see that to be anything that will really change our
trajectory of our CapEx investments. But there will be some IT requirements, but we feel that will be in
the normal course of business.

Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.
John Edward Heinbockel
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division
I want to go back to personalization again. Where do you think, just conceptually, the biggest
opportunities are, right? Because when you think about wallet share, every one of your members is going
to be a little different, but you can probably do cohorts. Where are they not buying from you and why?
Personalized promotions, outreach on new items coming into the warehouse, I mean where do you think
that the biggest opportunities are to build further wallet share?
Ron M. Vachris
President, CEO & Director
John, I'll go ahead and start out. I think the biggest opportunity is, just like you said, the awareness of
the warehouse and keeping our members in tune on what's active, what's going on in the warehouse near
them and how we can continue to enhance and drive those sales. I think that that's probably our greatest
opportunity with digital as we see moving forward.
Personalization is good. We talk here a lot about a fair reasonable amount of personalization. We never
want to compromise the Treasure Hunt of Costco. And that's equally as important as people that go to
costco.com never knew that they needed a 16-foot shed. And they see a phenomenal value as they do in

the warehouse. And so we don't want to personalize to a detriment. That changes our DNA and who we
are. But we do know that there's definitely some improvements we could have that would enhance the
member experience. And that's everything that our team is focused on, is that how does this move to the
member and how does it improve their experience with us digitally.
John Edward Heinbockel
Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division
Okay. And then as a follow-up, Gary, you talked a little bit about the core-on-core. But maybe step back
a little bit, and I know the idea is not necessarily to maximize margin, but maybe some thoughts on core-
on-core this quarter. And I think there had been pressure on fresh, right, as you kind of normalize post-
COVID, back to a regular level. Are we now through that process of fresh getting back down to a certain
level?
Gary Millerchip
Executive VP & CFO
Yes. Thanks, John. Just maybe to give you a little bit more color on the core-on-core, how it kind of played
out during the quarter, so if you think about the 3 main categories in core between foods and sundries,
fresh and nonfoods, fresh would have continued to being slightly lower year-over-year. And that's a very
deliberate strategy for us to make sure we're delivering more value for the member, and we think that's
a really important place for us to drive member engagement and support, especially as we're still seeing
some commodities that are a little bit inflationary right now. So that would have been very much part
of the plan from our perspective. But it was more than offset, as you mentioned, by the improvement in
nonfoods during the quarter, which was what led to the 10 basis point improvement on core-on-core. Food
and sundry actually was pretty flat overall.
So we feel good about the way that we're managing the balance while staying true to that principle of
delivering the best value for the member. And we were pleased with how it played out during the quarter
based on the work all the merchandising teams did.

Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird.
Peter Sloan Benedict
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Ron, maybe one for you. Just kind of back to the member behavior, maybe back to Scot's question a little
bit, can you just talk about maybe just your observations around maybe income cohorts? Any other ways
you bucket or slice your membership base, just how the behaviors have evolved here over the last several
months? Is there any change that you think is interesting to call out? You talked about the better general
nonfoods trends. Just curious if this environment reminds you of anything else historically. That's my first
question.
Ron M. Vachris
President, CEO & Director
Okay. It's a very healthy environment from what we see from our members right now. And as you take
a category such as our meat department, which is growing very nicely, a lot of volume being driven in
ground beef and our new everyday lower price on boneless skinless chicken breast, really driving a lot of
volume units there, while Wagyu beef and prime are growing at a great clip for us as well. So we're seeing
that benefit from both sides of the consumer that great value in both areas are doing very well.
The nonfoods, I'd tell you that nonfoods is strictly driven by newness and excitement. And we see big
and bulky going very well. It's been a year of our $1,200 swing set that we have on the floor. We can't
get enough. They're just blowing out. But it's, again, that continuous innovation of merchandise that is
exciting our members and really driving some sales for us there. Executive membership -- and that drives
our executive base because people are engaging at a much higher level.

Peter Sloan Benedict
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Good. So it sounds good across the board. We're expecting a dryer to get delivered from Costco Logistics
in the next couple of days, so looking forward to that. And then the second question would be on, Ron or
Gary, either of you, just your view on vertical sourcing. I mean this has been something that Costco has
been involved in for several years, going across different categories. As you guys continue to grow your
business, you need more, I guess, definable sources of supply. Just curious, your view of vertical sourcing,
where you are today and what areas you might focus on over the next several years.
Ron M. Vachris
President, CEO & Director
Sure. We've gotten into vertical integration and sourcing as the need arises. And if you think back in the
infamous story about the hot dog and Coke at $1.50 and how are you going to figure out how to keep
that price there, well, we're going to open our own meat plants. And as we looked at the prices of optical
lenses going up and then we opened up our optical grinding plant, so we did that to continue to look at
those things. The chicken plant came because we saw an inflection point where supply was not going to
meet demand. So we had to get involved and because we didn't have a partner that was willing to expand
into that area as well.
There is a focus that I have a group focused on, too, is that let's not try and be everything, no. We've got
a business to run here and we're not going to get vertically integrated just because it's something we can
do. It really is going to be driven by where the needs are and when do you need to step in. It's equally
we have great partners out there that supply our goods for us, and they're long-term suppliers. And so
strategically using that relationship is going to be the key in the future. So there's nothing that I could
announce at this time that we're going to expand into. But we continue to keep that in our back pocket
should we need to.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup.
Brandon Babcock Cheatham
Citigroup Inc., Research Division
This is Brandon Cheatham on for Paul. Recently, you were selling Instacart gift cards at a discount online
and in warehouse. I thought that was pretty interesting because it's potentially a gift card that could be
used at a competitor as well. So I'm just curious, is there any strategy behind that? Are you trying to drive
member engagement online? Is there any learnings from that initiative?
Ron M. Vachris
President, CEO & Director
The strategy behind it was another avenue to bring value to our members is really what that was about.
There is an upcharge on having grocery delivered to home. We work closely with Instacart, now we will
with Uber, to try and keep those costs at a minimum. But they've got people to pay on their side as well.
So the partnership was really to how do we continue to enhance that service for our members and drive
more sales. And so that was truly the -- yes, somebody can go out and use that somewhere else, but
again, our job is to save the members where we can. Be it airline tickets or Uber drive tickets or Instacart
shopping, we look at all those opportunities to add value to the member.
Brandon Babcock Cheatham
Citigroup Inc., Research Division
Got it. And my follow-up, how do warehouses react when you open an infill warehouse? Does it open
differently than other new markets? Does the current market feel an impact? And how many warehouses
that you opened over the past year would you quantify as infill versus new markets?

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 13



COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 30, 2024

President, CEO & Director
I guess how they react, we normally have good data before we'll open up an infill building and we can
judge, based on our member information, what cannibalization we'll realize in what building. So we're
able to get in front of that and adjust labor and payroll and buying and all those type of things for the
upcoming cannibalization that we plan. And our team does a very good job. They're normally within 1%
or so of what reality is to the execution of where our plans are as well. So we've gotten pretty good at
planning those things out. It's strategic.
The number of cannibalized locations, I'd have to tell you, I'd have to say that we probably opened 8
this year that cannibalized other buildings. Some may have cannibalized 1 warehouse. Others may be
in the middle. We had 1 in Toronto that cannibalized 4 buildings around it. But they've built back their
sales within 6 months. So those are the opportunities where you know, to Gary's earlier point, frequency
improves significantly because members can get back into a high-volume club. And so it's strategic
cannibalization, if you would, as we look around the world.

Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.
Gregory Scott Melich
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division
Ron, I wanted to follow up on the gross margin cap still very much in place at 14%, 15%. Is there any
reason that SG&A, now that it's back under 9% of sales, couldn't fall to 8% if you keep having the growth
that you have?
Ron M. Vachris
President, CEO & Director
No, that's a very good point. No, we continue to see -- I mean the company, we had a very healthy SG&A
number this quarter. Inventory was flowing very well. We had fresh goods coming through the system.
Our warehouses did a phenomenal job. SKU counts are in line. And so it's one of those things where all
the stars aligned. And this is the way we operate well, when you can deliver that kind of a top line growth
at our size now, our operators do a tremendous job leveraging that to the SG&A. So what could that get
to? I'd hate to say 8%, but I do think that we can have continued runway of driving down that number.
Gregory Scott Melich
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division
That's great to hear. And maybe some insight on gas gallons in the quarter, I know it was volatile and
there's certainly a feeling of pressure for a lot of members and consumers. Did that help the traffic
acceleration in the quarter, gas gallon growth?
Ron M. Vachris
President, CEO & Director
Yes. We were 5% up in gallons. And again, I think all of those things, when you can save people on gas,
that's also going to lend to your traffic as well. But gallons were up 5% for the quarter.
Gregory Scott Melich
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division
A great number. And if I could follow-up on gas, is the profitability in gas, Gary, kind of similar versus a
year ago or last quarter? Or is that trending up or down?
Gary Millerchip
Executive VP & CFO
Yes, the gas profitability would have been down a little bit. I think you may have heard me mention in
the prepared comments that, when we looked at the overall gross margin rate for the quarter, the sort of

headwind that we had was in the ancillary businesses, the other businesses. And it was essentially gas
that created that headwind, so we did see a reduction in gas profitability during the quarter. But overall,
the core-on-core margin improvement and e-commerce improvement essentially offset that to bring those
pretty close to flat overall when you adjust for gas inflation in the results. So it was down.
I would say, in general, what we've seen, on gas profitability, it's been relatively consistent to slightly
improving, if you look over the last few years. But obviously, there are points in time when you think
about volatility in fuel prices where you can have those ups or downs in any given quarter. And this last
quarter was one where we did see a headwind in year-over-year gas profitability.

Your next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.
Rupesh Dhinoj Parikh
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division
So just going back to unit growth, in recent years, it's been stuck in, let's call that mid-20s. It looks like
this year will be closer to 30. Just want to get a sense of the opportunities to potentially accelerate that
unit growth, especially in the U.S., just given some of your competitors are planning to accelerate growth
from here.
Ron M. Vachris
President, CEO & Director
I talked before about managed cannibalization and when you do these infills, and 29 locations is a solid
number for us. As you start getting into infills, some of these projects take a little longer. It's a little
tougher than -- there's not a whole lot of green land out there for us to go in and open up a warehouse.
So we have to do some creative things to find a way to infill in a very high market. International
expansion continues to be strong. Some of the countries or regions that we do business in take quite a bit
longer to get things done. So I think you'll see that ebb and flow. That number, 25 to 29 is -- or 25 to 30
is a good number for us. We feel good with our staffing and leadership and building up the infrastructure
behind these warehouses, so we open with great solid support there.
Rupesh Dhinoj Parikh
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division
Great. And then maybe just one follow-up question. So you guys added Uber to a number of locations. So
as you guys think about the intermediate to longer term, like would you expect multiple providers at all
Costco U.S. stores over time? So maybe just more the rationale in terms of adding Uber and that longer-
term vision.
Ron M. Vachris
President, CEO & Director
We were testing Uber for some time in Texas. We had a test going on there, and we did see a new cohort
of members engagement that are in the Uber platform. Uber also allowed us to expand our international
footprint, too. So we're going to be out in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, U.K., that we'll be expanding and where
we don't have grocery delivery now. So there were some real benefits to that relationship, along with the
long-standing Instacart relationship that we had that has been very good for many years. So we think that
it does open up the window for us for some new member engagement, and we also think that it's going to
be very good for us internationally and expansion there as well.

Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.
Christian Justin Carlino
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
It's Christian Carlino on for Chris. Could you speak to some of the innovation you're seeing in nonfoods
and anything else you think is driving some of the performance, particularly in the discretionary
categories? You called out toys, sporting goods and home, so maybe any incremental color you can
provide on those in particular. And while you're clearly gaining share, when you compare your own
performance of some of the syndicated data out there, does the emerging newness suggest there's also
somewhat of a rising tide in some of these categories that saw some pull-forward over the pandemic?
Ron M. Vachris
President, CEO & Director
Well, yes, I think if you look at -- you talked about the home category. And definitely, it's furnishings,
which is one that was quite soft post-pandemic that has come back strong in furniture, those type of
things. Home decor, it's some very unique items. I mean we've got 7-foot artificial trees that have come
in and just exploded out and just blowing out of the warehouses, and those are going at a nice clip.
Domestic's most unique items, Swedish dish towels, import items we're finding from around the world, are
doing very well. But it really comes down to unique items at great values that are exciting the members in
all those categories. The housewares category has been great. Sporting goods and toys, inflatable outdoor
toys have been a big, big category for us as well. We've added the Kirkland Signature driver into our golf
lineup, that sells out as quick as it goes online. So we're seeing wins in several different categories.
Christian Justin Carlino
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Got it. That's really helpful. And just broadly, are you seeing the competitive environment heat up in terms
of peers investing in price, particularly in nonfoods? You have some peers talking more and more about
looking to drive units, others are talking about a big step-up in appliance promotions recently. So any
color on what you're seeing competitively?
Ron M. Vachris
President, CEO & Director
There'll be ebbs and flows with the competition, but I'm very confident that we are always in the right
position, and we're staying ahead of that to keep the value there for our members. So those things are
cyclical, but we're going to be of value every day.
Gary Millerchip
Executive VP & CFO
And I think maybe just one thing to mention on that, Ron, too, you mentioned it earlier, but on the
appliances, obviously, making sure we're always very competitive on price, but I do think the acquisition
of Innovel, Costco Logistics now, and the value that we offer members there through both including the
delivery and the installation and the removal of the old appliance is proving to be a real differentiator for
us on the member experience as well.

COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 30, 2024

Gary, welcome, it's nice to be talking to you at Costco. So my first question is kind of the opposite of
what everyone asks all the time around the fee, but given some of the stuff you've outlined around media
and maybe driving the SG&A down, why do you need to increase the fee? Your sales are strong. Your
fee income growth is strong. Just because you've always done it doesn't mean you should do it. So what
would be the rationale behind driving a fee increase at this point?
Ron M. Vachris
President, CEO & Director
Fee increases go back to the members in lower prices. I mean that's one of the key parts that we use that
money for, is that it allows us to broaden that distance from the competition and bring greater values and
improving our operation overall for the member. So that's the primary focus.
Scott Andrew Mushkin
R5 Capital LLC
Okay. And then my next question actually kind of dovetails on the last one, but you guys talked about
the consumer being a little bit better overall. And I guess what I was wondering, is that really a Costco
phenomenon? In other words, are you gaining share and that's what's really driving your improvements in
some of these categories like electronics and appliances and big-ticket rather than the consumer actually
getting better? Is there any way to tease that out?
Ron M. Vachris
President, CEO & Director
I would say that, that's very fair. Our merchants report monthly on industry trends in the country and
internationally as we're seeing, and we can see our sales performance compared to the rest of the market.
And I would think that you're spot-on when you say that we're gaining market share.
Gary Millerchip
Executive VP & CFO
Scott, maybe one thing I would just add, too, is I think we're all reading a lot about the consumer, of
course, and what they're going through right now. And I think what we see is that value and quality has
never been more important. And so that plays to, as Ron described earlier, what we deliver. And we're
making sure that the teams are laser-focused on every day delivering that value and quality. And so I
think we're drawing customers to what Costco has offered for many years, and it's never more relevant
than now based on what we're hearing from members and consumers.

you talk a little bit more about how you think about the areas of reinvestment? I'm sure you probably
have already done a lot of work around like where you would like that to go. Is there anything that's
unique about where reinvestment might come to this time around? Just thoughts around that.
Ron M. Vachris
President, CEO & Director
It moves as time moves and you see pricing in categories and where we have the greatest opportunity
to be more competitive for our members. And it may be in an area that fresh foods is seeing some price
inflation, we may invest more in the fresh foods department for that period of time. The nice part about
our model with 3,600, 3,700 SKUs is we're still quite nimble as big as we are, so we can shift. Based on
the needs of our members and where we think the best investment in margin would take care of them,

we're able to shift that thought process and move it around. So I wouldn't say that there's any set, okay,
if membership fee goes up, it's going to be spent in these areas. We work as a team and we continue to
monitor it throughout the year, and we act as needed.
Edward Joseph Kelly
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Okay. And just a quick follow-up on club throughput, it's remarkable how you drive off to a Costco Club
and it's hard to find a place to park, but yet you guys can still comp the way that you do. How are you
thinking about throughput, ways to improve that? And I don't know if both buy online and pick up is part
of that, how do you think of things like scan and go or maybe it's club density? Just curious as to how you
solve for that over time.
Ron M. Vachris
President, CEO & Director
A good part of those are things like our e-commerce business and how we can move some of those goods
out of the warehouse and move that business online. And as Gary spoke to, now that we have control over
Costco Logistics, we can bring great value to that experience as well.
We continue to look at technology. We're testing some front-door scanners that are speeding up our
registers significantly. When we got all the scanning and memberships are verified at the front door,
it has shown a significant improvement in our register speed. And so that, in turn, turns over parking
spaces much quicker. And so those kind of things, along with strategic infills to help open up parking
opportunities and gas expansions where those are needed as well. So there are several different levers
that we'll continue to pull on how we can best serve the member in that building and where we need to
make sure that we can look at throughput.

in electronics previously, previously, it was a bit of a drag, just would love your thoughts on what you're
seeing there. And third part is marketplace, the marketplace model and the concession model and
alternative inventory models. Just what are your views of opportunities there because they're really big
ones and your member is so loyal to you as well.

And we've seen a great success in international foods that have been brought into the U.S. and of the
like from the U.S. into the other regions of the world where we do business. But you want to take care of
not only the consumables in the grocery side, but when we bring in an item that's a success in Taiwan or
Korea or the U.K., and it creates that excitement for the member, that's when we really have done a good

job of triggering that impulsive purchase where members are trusting the buyers and they will add that
additional item to their cart. So that's been a big win for us.
And again, it goes a lot of times with that Treasure Hunt. I mean you've heard the plays, people come in
to spend $100 and walk out with $300, that's because our buyers do and our operators do a great job in
making the warehouses exciting and keeping those on the forefront of what they're -- when they come in
and do their basic shopping, they pick up a few additional items that just compel them at the time.
Gary Millerchip
Executive VP & CFO
I think maybe just to add on that, Ron, too, I mean the nice thing about the opportunity there for us is,
with trips up by 5%, that's really why the average basket size has been more flat recently. And that's
because we've been growing member engagement in consumables, as Ron mentioned, with food and
fresh. And so it does present a great opportunity, and I think it also speaks to the team doing a good job
of driving more frequency of member visits. So it creates a great opportunity for us to drive more of that
basket size as well.
Ron M. Vachris
President, CEO & Director
And then your question on marketplace, it's a significant opportunity for us moving forward. I mean we
really do indeed see that. I think, especially with our limited SKU count in the warehouse, how can we
expand the offering to our members, bring value to their membership card beyond what's within our four
walls or what's on costco.com, and we see this as a great growth driver for us in the future and a way to
bring expanded value to the members as we look forward. So I'm quite bullish on Costco Next and what
that can become in the future.
Gary Millerchip
Executive VP & CFO
I think the difference for us on that would be, of course, as we are with Costco Next is just being very
curated for the members. So unlike a traditional marketplace that is about maybe just sheer volume, for
us, it's about making sure the member is getting something that truly is unique and valuable and being
consistent with who we are. There's tremendous upside opportunity there in that regard.
Oliver Chen
TD Cowen, Research Division
Okay. And finally, on that big-ticket question, would love any green shoots on electronics or TVs. And the
last question, on Asia, you've had same-day in China, and you've done a lot of great things in the Asian
region. Just would love any update there in terms of progress you made and the big opportunity for more
infills as well.
Gary Millerchip
Executive VP & CFO
Yes. I think just briefly on electronics, we believe -- I think Ron referenced earlier, we look a lot of the
market data, and we believe that we're winning with the member there in terms of the value that we're
delivering and when we look at our trends versus the market, so we feel good about our ability to continue
to outpace the market there. And we're seeing a good opportunity within digital, in particular, to really
drive more connection with the member and take some of those big-ticket items from the warehouse to
online as well.
And in Asia, I think, it would be consistent with what we've talked about with warehouses in the past that
we think all of the markets offer us a great opportunity for growth. Some of those markets in Asia are
more mature, but there's still significant opportunities to open new warehouses and fill in those markets.
And then, obviously, we have markets like China where we're really just sort of starting that journey, but
there's tremendous growth opportunity as we identify the right path forward in that market.

A lot have been asked, but I did want to ask, with Costco Logistics, what was driving that 28% increase,
which is very strong? Was it new relationships with some of the other retailers or partnerships? Just
anything you could share on that would be helpful.
Ron M. Vachris
President, CEO & Director
Yes. We only deliver Costco members' orders through Costco Logistics. There are no partnerships going
through those numbers that you see. We do a trace amount of Sears numbers, but that's not in any of the
numbers that we report the growth in. That is just part of the past relationship that's there as well. And it
is appliances, furnishings and outdoor were the 3 big drivers. Appliances were almost 30% growth for us
in the period. And again, to Gary's point, it's that member value of all-in, what-you-see-is-what-you-pay
price for delivery, installation, haul away, everything you need done at one time that has really resonated
with our members and has been a great driver of sales for us.
Gary Millerchip
Executive VP & CFO
Joe, I'll give you the practical example. As a new entrant to the Seattle market, I just had Costco Logistics
deliver 2 mattresses, 3 TVs and a couple of chairs as well for me. So that's the kind of stuff I think that
we're seeing really resonate with members.
Joseph Isaac Feldman

Got it. That's great. And then just one other question, I know it's still relatively small, I think but the
Costco Next, it seems like it's ramping nicely. I guess how will that continue to ramp in the future? Like,
where do you see that going? And how important is that a driver? Like, is that sort of the basis for this
marketplace that Oliver was just asking about?
Ron M. Vachris
President, CEO & Director
As Gary mentioned earlier, Costco Next is a bit unique, but it is a fully curated marketplace. As
there's many other marketplaces out there that are just for somebody to go on and sell goods in this
marketplace, these are relationships that our buyers have with our suppliers, and we're creating new
suppliers as well. This has not only been a new way to sell goods. We've also found that we can find some
really neat items that are selling through Costco Next that we, in turn, then bring into our warehouse.
So it is a great testing ground for newness, new items, a way to expand categories of accessories for
certain categories. You have swing sets that we sell online, but you have additional swings and slides
and other activities that you sell that we normally wouldn't be able to fit into a warehouse. So it really
complements the core warehouse business but gives us an opportunity to expand member value to these
other partners as well. So we see a lot of upside there.
