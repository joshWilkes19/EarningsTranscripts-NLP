Michelle M. MacKay
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

Thank you, Megan. I've now been the CEO of Cushman & Wakefield for a year, and the progress our teams have
made during that time has been impressive. We have never settled committing to what we have said and
executing on our plan relentlessly, setting clear targets and goals for what we needed to achieve for ourselves
and for our investors, and then getting it done.
Let me speak about exceeding those targets. A year ago, we started off strong refinancing over $1 billion of debt
and committing to reducing our leverage by a minimum of $200 million by midyear 2025. We have already
reduced our debt by $100 million through the second quarter, and we plan to make another $50 million reduction
this quarter, putting us ahead of our plans. We have also reduced our interest costs twice this year on both of our
outstanding term loans as we continue to have staunch support from our term loan lenders; in both cases,
exceeding our plan.
We have also exceeded our plans on free cash flow conversion, reporting a substantial improvement of more than
$130 million in year-to-date free cash flow versus the prior year period. And today, we are reporting our third
consecutive quarter of leasing revenue growth, our fifth consecutive quarter of meeting or beating expectations,
and for the first half of 2024, our adjusted EBITDA margins are up over 40 basis points compared to the same
period last year.
To add to all of this, we announced the sale of a non-core asset, which was targeted for sale late last year and
whose proceeds will be used to reduce leverage and fuel growth. We are getting it done in every aspect of our
business every day.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Neil to review the second quarter financials, and then I'll come back and speak to you
in more detail about our plans for growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil O. Johnston
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

Thank you, Michelle, and good afternoon everyone. Second quarter trends demonstrated continued strength in
our leasing business and highlighted the work we've done to drive improved profitability and cash flow. While fee
revenue of $1.6 billion for the second quarter was down 2% versus prior year and adjusted EBITDA of $139
million was down 4%, adjusted EBITDA on a year-to-date basis has grown 6% and adjusted EPS of $0.20 is
$0.02 higher than the last year for the six-month period.
Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the second quarter increased sequentially to 8.8%, taking the margin for the first
six months to 7%, up 44 basis points over prior year, as cost savings and operational efficiencies offset the impact
of inflation and lower revenue. Taking a look at our services line results, our leasing business continues to
perform well, growing 2% in the quarter. The growth in Q2 was again largely global in nature, with Americas
leasing up 2%, APAC leasing up 7% and EMEA leasing flat. In the Americas, we continue to see solid
performance in midsized leasing deals, which demonstrates the breadth of stabilization in the leasing market.
Industrial, office and retail leasing all grew in the quarter. In EMEA, we experienced growth in Central and Eastern
Europe, while Germany underperformed. APAC saw particular strength in India and Japan. Our capital markets
fee revenue declined 14%. [ph] Facing the (05:24) strong second quarter last year, which was our highest quarter
of capital markets revenue for the year, Americas capital markets revenue declined 19%, but grew 19%
sequentially, showing increased momentum. Revenues in the quarter increased in industrial and retail, while the

29-Jul-2024

office and multifamily sectors saw declines. EMEA and APAC continue to show strength, up 7% and 19%,
respectively.
Turning to services, revenue was flat versus the prior year, adjusting for the previously discussed contract
change, or down 2% as reported. Our APAC services business remains strong, achieving second quarter growth
of 9%, once again, driven by strong project management performance, particularly in India and Australia. While
EMEA services revenues declined in the quarter, we did see services margins grow, setting a solid foundation for
profitable growth.
In the Americas, services revenue was flat for the quarter, excluding the contract change, or down 3% as
reported. Facility services grew 2%. Property management revenues were flat, while project development
services declined, as office clients deferred expansion plans. We expect to see improvements in this business
line, as office leasing activity accelerates.
In our GOS business, we are pleased with some very large wins that we've signed this year, including the global
mandate for Standard Chartered Bank. Weaker multifamily transaction volumes have impacted our Greystone
joint venture, which experienced a $6 million year-over-year decline in equity income contribution. We expect
Greystone earnings to remain pressured in the short term, but to benefit from a transactional market recovery in
multifamily when it occurs.
Today, we announced the divestiture of a small non-core services business. This business has historically
contributed $120 million to $140 million in annual revenue at mid-teens margins. We sold the business for a
transaction value of $165 million and will receive gross cash proceeds of approximately $130 million at close,
which is expected to occur during the third quarter. We plan to use the proceeds for strategic growth investments
and debt pay-down, consistent with our long-term capital allocation strategy.
Shifting to cash flow and the balance sheet, we continue to make considerable progress on free cash flow
conversion. Free cash flow for the quarter was $10 million versus a $27 million use of cash in the second quarter
of 2023. Our first half cash flow usage of $126 million compares favorably to 2023, improving by over $130
million, driven by our ongoing efforts around working capital efficiencies.
During the quarter, we repaid $45 million of term loan debt due in 2025, reducing the outstanding balance to $98
million. We also repriced an additional $1 billion of Term Loan B due in 2030 late in the quarter, lowering the
applicable interest rate by 35 basis points. Year-to-date, we have repriced $2 billion in term loans and paid down
$100 million in debt, all of which is expected to reduce our annual cash interest expense by approximately $14
million.
Finally, moving to our full-year outlook. On the revenue side, we continue to expect leasing revenue growth in the
low- to mid-single-digit range and improving capital markets revenue growth in the second half of the year. In
services, we expect flat organic revenue growth, returning to mid-single-digit organic growth during 2025.
On the cost side, we expect inflation and higher incentive compensation to be mostly offset by our cost efficiency
measures for the full year. In the third quarter, we expect expenses to be roughly $25 million to $30 million higher
than last year, primarily due to a resetting of incentive compensation, which had been reduced in last year's third
quarter.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Michelle.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call

29-Jul-2024

Michelle M. MacKay
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

Thanks, Neil. Now, let's pivot to growth. We've spent the last year building the foundation of an enterprise that
creates the best platform possible to accelerate and drive performance for 2025 and beyond. Our strategy for
growth and the allocation of capital to drive our business forward is predicated on the philosophy that the world of
commercial real estate has fundamentally changed. And if we want to win, old playbooks must be thrown out.
The way that we approach and engage with clients incorporates a more integrated, built world. Silos must be
broken down, and the enterprise must be connected in the way that we recruit talent, manage relationships and
invest in our portfolio of services. And we see huge potential for our integrated platform and the more connected
way in which we are now operating.
Since the beginning of the year, we have been realigning our capital allocation to this philosophy. We have
heightened collaboration between our research and our sales teams, allowing us to more effectively target
regions and subsectors for growth investments in our leasing business. And it is clear, through our results over
the past few quarters, that our strategy has paid off.
We are laser-focused on providing integrated insights and execution for our clients. And to that end, we have
been recruiting and protecting accretive talent and modernizing our capital markets platform to provide the
sophisticated service and data our clients need. And we are actively managing our portfolio and balance sheet to
position the company for profitable future growth.
We have sold non-core assets and walked away from less accretive services businesses, taking some short-term
pain for the clear long-term benefit of a stronger client base and increasing flexibility to invest in higher value
services opportunities. You will see us option into organic and inorganic investments to drive growth. Our hardearned results over the past year reflect the grit and the dedication to clients that define our teams and culture at
Cushman & Wakefield. We are proud of what we have delivered on and energized about the opportunities we will
create in the quarters and years ahead.
Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator?

Q2 2024 Earnings Call

29-Jul-2024

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question
comes from Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Stephen Sheldon
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC

Q

Hey, thanks. Really appreciate you taking my questions here. First, Michelle, I wanted to maybe ask about some
of the commentary you just had. Can you just talk some about your producer capacity, as we think about leasing
and capital markets, as industry activity continues to recover here? I know you don't report producer head count
[ph] in order to manage your (12:41) peers, but how is your senior producer head count looking now versus this
point last year? And generally, how do you think about your positioning to benefit, as transaction volumes seem
poised to increase?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michelle M. MacKay
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

A

Yeah, you're right. We don't report out producer number, if you will, but we are up from last year as an overall
number. And so, the capacity has been great. I think what you're seeing that really play through first is our leasing
and a lot of our leasing talent that we have retained is just doing exceptionally, especially in some of the larger
deals.
I talked a couple times on the earnings calls about 100,000 and 200,000 square foot transactions that they're
doing as well in the core markets as well. So, we're really spread equally and well between, say, the 20,000
square foot tenant and the 200,000 square foot tenant. And in capital markets, we set up a program in the
beginning of the year to make sure and ensure that we were locking down and locking in our key capital markets
talent.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Stephen Sheldon
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC

Q

Got it. That's helpful. Good to hear. And then maybe just on services, can you talk some about what you're seeing
in terms of winning new large contracts? How is that progressing relative to your expectations? And can you just
give some more detail about the types of solutions that are seeing stronger demand right now in that segment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michelle M. MacKay
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

A

Yeah. Let me go a bit into how things have changed. I think that's going to be helpful. What you can see play out
in the big game today with our services clients is you have to have the global platform where you will be invited
into the conversation. And we talked about how there's a multipronged decision going on, on the client side that
includes meeting patterns and employees in having that data, workplace experience, shifting demographics, ESG,
supply chain complexities, e-commerce trends, things like power usage. So, to be able to address the right now
needs of the clients, you have to have these siloed organizations. I made a reference to that in my script. Your
senior leadership across the globe has to be pulled in together and share all the best practices again and again
and always.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call

29-Jul-2024

And some examples of this kind of work and wins that we're getting, Neil made reference to Standard Chartered.
We also won a very large transaction in EMEA earlier in the year where we had to bring in that worldwide
perspective. And [ph] DTCC (15:04) was also a big win for us and very complicated RFP, global portfolio
optimization work.
But that's how the client is thinking now, not just about how much space am I going to take up. So, we've
expanded into consulting on these transactions, bringing a team together, that's financial analysis, interior
workplace stuff, location analysis, tenant rep and we competed against nine firms for something like that. But the
truth is, how many of those firms do you really think were qualified to do something that integrated? Not many.
And so, what we know now is that in order to continue to service and grow with the client, you have to have a
culture that embraces constant change.

Got it. Thank you. Appreciate all the color.

Operator: The next question comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ronald Kamdem
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Q

Hey. Just two quick ones. So, staying on services a little bit, I think you talked about organic revenue growth flat in
2024, but potentially getting to mid-single digits sort of next year. Just if you could just double-click on that
comment, what kind of visibility or what gives you sort of confidence that you can get there and so forth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil O. Johnston
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

A

Sure, Ron. If you think about services, let's say, there are lots of components to that. Our story has remained
pretty consistent this year. If we break it up by geography, for example, in APAC, the business is strong. It's seen
8% year-over-year growth and it continues to grow. We are the largest facilities management providers in
Singapore and we are expanding our client base with seeing very nice margins there.
On the EMEA side is where we did a lot of restructuring during the year and we focused on our design and build
business where we basically worked on improving margins. The great news there is some of those projects are
more short term in nature. So, as we move through those contracts, we should see a pickup there.
Our facilities services business in the US is a very large business for us, a business we like a lot. That business
has grown 2% this year, but we are seeing some good wins there and so feel pretty good about getting that back
to mid- to high-single-digit growth as we look through 2025. Michelle spoke about primarily our Global Occupier
Services business. That business, once again, big wins. Now, those are very long contracts, so that'll take a while
for us to see that momentum build, but that would sort of be what fuels the global services business.
And then finally, where we have had some pressure is around the property management, project management
business. That's all very short term in nature and with the office and the constraints in build-outs in office, we've
seen that business be challenged in the short term. But, once again, it's very short term, so we expect that to pick
up quite quickly and really drive the growth through 2025.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call

29-Jul-2024

Ronald Kamdem

Q

Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Great. And then just my second question was just kind of coming back to capital markets a little bit. I know we've
had a lot of fits and starts. Just curious what you're seeing on the ground in July and so forth and what the
messaging to the market is. Is it sort of green shoots? Is it still too early? Just trying to get a sense of where we
are in that sort of recovery process. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michelle M. MacKay

A

Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

Yeah. I'm going to answer that one for you. What we are looking at here is what we're calling internally a waterfall
effect. So, we believe the majority of the uncertainty around rates and inflation has started to move into the
rearview mirror. These things – our inflation data like we all know and the economy has remained really resilient.
So, this is positive for our capital markets and we started to see leasing take the lead. And we believe when the
Fed cuts rates, which we believe will be soon, it will signal to the market that it's time to move into commercial real
estate, if you haven't done it already, into capital markets. And we expect some of the money on the sidelines to
engage really quickly, but that may result in close transactions showing up through the beginning of 2025.
Subsequent rate cuts are going to create this waterfall effect because we think that more assets will start to move
in as rates are reduced and that 2023 and 2024 for capital markets is going to be a year that people will
remember as to smart investors got into commercial real estate. On our side, when we're looking [ph] to see
(19:33) what's happening, if you look back at last quarter, we're starting to see some really strong trends,
especially in areas that we invested in, like APAC up 19%, where we invested in capital markets in Australia in
particular over the course of the last year. EMEA up 7%, as we're seeing some strong pipelines there, especially
in markets like the UK.
And in the Americas, we're sequentially up quarter to quarter, and industrial is starting to return to growth, it's up
17% over that period after six consecutive quarters of decline. So, we're really looking forward to the market that's
coming. And we have really intentionally set ourselves up really well to take advantage of it.

Ronald Kamdem

Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Operator: The next question comes from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Anthony Paolone

Q

Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Thanks. Maybe just first to understand the brackets around the business for the full year versus last quarter. I
mean, how would you sum it up in comparison to how you were feeling about 2024 in its entirety? Like, is this
better or not as good as last quarter? Because I'm just trying to read through some of the language here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil O. Johnston
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

A

Tony, I think it's turning out exactly as we expected. But certainly on the expense side, we focused on the first half
of the year really driving margin and we saw the margin improvement. So, that was very encouraging. We did

29-Jul-2024

expect a step back in capital markets. And actually, sequentially, it grew around 19%. So, we are seeing that
business pick up.
And then on the leasing side, really exceeded expectations. The leasing numbers are slightly [ph] hidden (21:23)
by a very strong second quarter a year ago, particularly in New York. And so, we had a tough comp [ph] with new
(21:31) on the leasing side. But what we've seen is, we see the broadening of the leasing market and we've seen
– this is the third quarter of growth. Just to give you an anecdote in the Americas, our office leasing in the core
and midsized deals was at 19% versus 8% in the second [ph] quarter – overall (21:50) in the first quarter. So, just
a lot of pipeline building. So, overall, I think it's working out – it's turning out to be – we're ahead of plans with the
six months.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Anthony Paolone

Q

Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Okay. And then I guess then on the second question I would have the margins. You picked up 40 bps in the first
half of the year versus last year. I mean, how should we think about just the full year and the way things are
tracking in terms of order of magnitude to change?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil O. Johnston

A

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

Sure. Sure. So, exactly consistent with what we said at the beginning of the year. Our teams did exceptional work
towards the end of last year and earlier this year to drive those margins. And we saw the margin accretion as we
expected. As we look to the back half of the year, we will have the incentive compensation difference in Q3 as a
result of pulling down incentive compensation a year ago. But other than that, we expect that our efficiencies will
offset any of the growth investment.
As we look forward, we really are looking for a balance between how we're investing and how we're managing
margins. So, very focused on accretive growth, but at the same time being very intentional around our spend so
that we're very well positioned for the recovery. We feel like we are at the bottom of the cycle, and so we want to
be ahead of that as we come out towards the end of the year and into next year.

Michael A. Griffin
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.

Q

Great. Thanks. I wanted to go back to kind of your commentary there, Neil, on the leasing market, particularly for
the office side. As we think about it, I think we've heard that it continues to be those Trophy and Class A product
that's still winning kind of most of the deals. But given what seems like a rosier picture for the market overall, have
you noticed a pickup and maybe that kind of lower tier office space leasing up? Or is it still mainly geared toward
that high quality product?

I think, Michael, it's stayed on the high quality. I think high quality has just performed exceptionally well in major
markets in New York and other large markets. We have seen a pickup though in the smaller and midsized deals.
So, that's a change and a positive change as what we're seeing is we're seeing a broadening of the leasing
market.
Companies are now starting to say, okay, the work from home phenomenon has now sort of – it's been in the
rearview mirror. We need to have the space for our people to be in at least three days a week. So, I think that's
broadening. And then also leasing globally was up, [ph] there was consistency (24:41) by geography. And so, all
of that points to a healthier market as we look into the back half and again into next year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael A. Griffin

Q

Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.

Great. That's helpful. And then just turning kind of to capital allocation priorities, Michelle, I know you kind of laid
out your thoughts for the back half of the year in your prepared remarks. But I mean, should we think about right
now as trying to prioritize the balance sheet, paying down debt or could we see you pivot to offense, whether it's
M&A or other excellent growth opportunities if the right thing comes along?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michelle M. MacKay

A

Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

Yeah, absolutely. I mean, we are in a growth mindset [ph] headspace (25:17) and we know that we can walk and
chew gum at the same time. So, you heard us today announce we're going to pay down another $50 million this
quarter. We have some cash coming in from the asset sale. But equally as important, we are doing really well on
free cash flow. So, that opens up all the pockets for us, whether that's small M&A, M&A or organic investing in the
businesses.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Peter Abramowitz
Analyst, Jefferies LLC

Q

Yes. Thank you. So, you just – you would call out weakness in the capital markets, just kind of due to the
uncertainty of the rate environment. Just seems like the market may be turning the corner here late in the quarter
and potentially into the third quarter. Can you just comment on how things have sort of progressed through July?
And then also just in terms of the timing of a turnaround with some rate stability here for the last couple of months,
I guess, when do you expect things to start to inflect?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michelle M. MacKay
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

A

I mean, I think, first of all, we're not going to comment on July, but the inflection point will be the first time the Fed
makes the move. That will start to lead people into the right place to make decisions. But it's probably going to be
a small move, let's say, it's 25 basis points. What you'll see is some assets transacting immediately, but we

believe the volume or the waterfall, as we refer to it, will actually begin to happen late in the year and the
beginning of next year into 2025 because the first move isn't material in that it will probably be small.

Analyst, Jefferies LLC

Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then one just a follow-up on Michael's question, similar question, but just
digging into it a little bit more. Just given some of the comments around your strength on leasing, just wondering,
within office and geographically, have you seen any points of strength specifically within some of the gateway
