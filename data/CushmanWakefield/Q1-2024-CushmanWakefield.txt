Michelle M. MacKay
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

Thank you, Megan. In 2023, we spoke with you frequently about positioning ourselves in a thoughtful way for the
recovery. And as you can see from our performance, the actions that we took in support of these words created
strong first quarter results. Since the last time that we spoke, our teams have seized market opportunities and we
continue to strengthen our balance sheet, including our first optional prepayment of debt, as well as successfully
repricing our 2030 term loan, reducing our annual cash interest costs.
We reported another quarter of global leasing growth and saw meaningful improvements in Capital Markets.
We've had a couple of key wins in our Services businesses in the last month alone, as we continue to step away
from less accretive Services transactions. And importantly, we achieved these results while maintaining cost
discipline, leading to an improvement of more than 100 basis points in adjusted EBITDA margin.
Looking at the big picture, the year is generally progressing in line with expectations. On our last earnings call, I
said that we're expecting a moderate initial reduction in rates sometime later in the year. Our view from the onset
has been that the Fed was likely to remain cautious this year and our strategy and budgeting decisions were
made in accordance with that view. Our outlook and optimism for the recovery are strong, and we continue to
position our business in a thoughtful way for this next stage in the cycle.
Given the recent increase in rate volatility, I'd like to take a couple of minutes to share our thoughts on how we
view the relationship between the Fed rate cuts and our business. Because, overall, we view the Fed rate cuts as
an accelerator of certain parts of the business, but not the only avenue for transactional improvements. Our first
quarter results provide some insights into these dynamics, illustrating what occurs when there is rate stability,
economic optimism, a solid pipeline of deals, and strong teams armed with a clearly defined strategy.
We expect that Leasing, which is a particular strength of ours, will continue to benefit from global economic
resiliency as we move through the cycle. And our diverse platform allows us to capture pockets of strength across
regions and asset classes, as we have positioned ourselves to do for the past several quarters.
During the quarter, we saw continued solid growth in Leasing across our global platform, with revenues up 5% for
the second quarter in a row. And on the Capital Markets side of the business, activity in Q1 reflected transactions
closing in the early part of the quarter when there was more optimism over a potential first rate cut from the Fed.
Although the recent uptick in rate volatility will most likely cause a pause in transaction volumes in Q2, the
improvement that we experienced in Q1 gives us more confidence that global investment sales pipelines are solid
and investors are ready to engage when the time is right.
I'm pleased with our first quarter performance and the way in which our teams continue to execute and find
opportunities across our segments and geographies. The clarity that the reset strategy has given management is
already paying dividends in a more cohesive and connected approach to the way that we are operating the
company and interacting with our clients.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Neil.

Thank you, Michelle, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our first quarter results, which
exceeded our expectations and guidance, with fee revenue of $1.5 billion, flat with the prior year, and adjusted

EBITDA of $78 million, up 29% versus prior year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 5.2% grew 117 basis points, as
we benefited from higher leasing revenue as well as the cost savings actions taken during 2023. Adjusted
earnings per share for the quarter was breakeven, an improvement from the $0.04 loss a year ago.
By segment, fee revenue declined 3% in the Americas, grew 3% in EMEA and grew 8% in APAC. We saw margin
expansion in both the Americas and EMEA, due to strong leasing growth and our 2023 cost actions, while
margins in APAC contracted slightly due primarily to mix.
Taking a look at our service lines, effective January 1, we have renamed the property, facilities and project
management service line to Services. This change is in name only and had no impact on the composition of our
service lines or our historical results.
Beginning with brokerage, our leasing business continue to experience stabilizing trends we reported in the fourth
quarter, with 5% revenue growth. The growth in Q1 was again global in nature, with Americas leasing up 1%,
EMEA leasing up 30%, and APAC leasing up 10%. In the Americas, we saw particular strength in mid-sized office
and industrial leasing, which grew in each of our sub-regions for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2022. In
EMEA, we transacted on a large deal in Germany, which accounted for roughly a third of the leasing growth in
that region. The remaining growth came from strength in all of our major asset classes with office, industrial and
retail, each up over 10% in the quarter. In APAC, India continues to see healthy growth supported by durable
megatrends in global outsourcing and data centers.
Our capital markets revenue declined 1%. A meaningful sequential improvement over the 32% year-over-year
decline reported in the fourth quarter of last year. Americas cap markets revenue was down 7%, while EMEA and
APAC revenues were up 12% and 52%, respectively. In the Americas, we experienced a pickup in pipeline
conversion early in the quarter, particularly in office transactions, as interest rates were relatively stable and bidask spreads narrowed. In EMEA, buyer and seller expectations on pricing and values are realigning, particularly
in prime assets and better locations. And in APAC, office and industrial sales were strong, most notably in
Australia, where we've made some recent growth investments.
We're encouraged by these results, but acknowledge that the recent increase in interest rate volatility is likely to
cause a short-term reversal of trends in the second quarter as the market adjusts. Ultimately, however, our first
quarter results provide us increased confidence that transactions will return to the market in greater volume when
rates stability is achieved.
Turning to Services, revenue was down 3% or flat with prior year adjusting for the previously discussed contract
change. In the Americas, Services revenue declined 5% or 1%, excluding contract change. And in EMEA,
Services revenue declined 9% as we continue to reposition our service portfolio for profitable growth. In APAC,
our Services business was strong, up 7%, driven by solid growth in project management and facilities
management. Overall, we are pleased with the momentum we are seeing in Services.
We have recently had some notable new business wins and our new business pipeline is strong. As we've
previously discussed, while our focus on margin and accretive growth is resulting in some near-term revenue
headwinds, we expect to see a reacceleration of growth in the second half of this year and a return to at least a
mid-single digit growth rate in 2025.
Turning to cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was a use of $136 million. This compared favorably to the first
quarter of 2023, where free cash flow was a use of $231 million. A first quarter use of cash is in line with historical

working capital trends, including annual payment of US bonuses and reflects typical seasonal patterns in our
business.
We continued our progress on strengthening the balance sheet. During the quarter, we repaid $50 million of [ph]
Term Loan B (00:10:10) due in 2025, reducing the outstanding balance to $143 million. In addition, subsequent to
quarter end, we repriced $1 billion of [ph] Term Loan B due 2030, reducing the applicable interest rate by 25 basis
points for one-month SOFR plus 400 basis points to one-month term SOFR plus 375 basis points. The net impact
of these actions is expected to reduce annual cash interest expense by roughly $6 million.
Finally, moving to our outlook. We continue to expect the sustained growth in capital markets is most likely to
begin sometime in the second half of this year, contingent upon a more conducive interest rate environment. We
expect the leasing market to be relatively stable for the year and for our Services business to grow at a similar
rate to 2023. On the cost side, we continue to expect cost increases driven by normal inflation and higher
incentive comp as we focus on positioning the Company for market growth. However, we do expect our cost
efficiency initiatives to mostly offset these cost headwinds within the year.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Michelle.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call

29-Apr-2024

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time
we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. The first question comes from Anthony Paolone with
JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Anthony Paolone

Q

Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

[ph] All right. (00:12:28) Thanks. Good afternoon. First question is just looking at the first quarter margin. I know
it's a seasonally slow quarter and I don't want to make too much of it, but as we think about 2024, should we think
about that 100-or-so basis points of margin expansion as being the right order of magnitude if the businesses hit
the bracket you put around them?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil O. Johnston

A

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

Tony, I think the reason we gave guidance on the first quarter was because we did have the cost program that
rolled into savings in 2024. So, in the first quarter, we had $20 million of savings which did offset – more than
offset the cost increases we saw. So, if we look at that margin improvement, it was essentially half driven by those
cost savings and the other half driven by the improvement in up-leasing, the flow-through of leasing.
As we look now on out for the rest of the year, as we said on our full year outlook, we do expect the remaining
cost actions to basically offset inflation and the cost increases. So, the margin expansion that we will get in the
back half of the year is tied primarily to operating leverage. So, as you think about the year, think about growth in
leasing, what's happening in [ph] capital market (00:13:46) services, and so, that is sort of how to frame up
margins for the full year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Anthony Paolone

Q

Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Okay. So, that the first quarter, it seemed like it had a bit more than that and it sort of basically kind of keep that in
mind, is that kind of the takeaway?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil O. Johnston

A

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

That's exactly correct. Yes. Yes. It all depends – [ph] Even if we (00:14:04) depend on the recovery.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Anthony Paolone
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Q

Okay. And my second question is just in the Services segment. I guess, you're still looking for 2% to 3% growth in
2024 for the full year. I'm wondering how much of that is speculative in terms of contracts that you start yet to win
versus where you put a high degree of visibility and that you're just waiting for things to commence. And I guess
along the same lines, since you've been really reworking that segment, do you think you'll make more EBITDA in
2024 than you did in 2023?

Q1 2024 Earnings Call

29-Apr-2024

Michelle M. MacKay

A

Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

Hi, Tony. It's Michelle. Just to start off with Services, I'm really excited about our positioning in Services, and as
we've said in prior quarters, we're hyper focused on accretive long-term growth in that business. So, as you know,
we've been fine tuning our strategy here and expect to be back to our long-term growth rate in the mid-single
digits in 2025.
In the GOS business and just to give you a little color on where we're winning, what's happening, we're beginning
to win business in marquee deals when it's important to the clients that we're balancing being globally scaled, but
also having agility. And we've had a couple of key wins this year. Some of them will play into revenue later in the
year and some of them will play into next year.
And then, for the smaller clients, to your point around what's more speculative, those can transact more quickly in
the year. And honestly, those are great deals. Those are critical [indiscernible] (00:15:39) to us. They're higher
margin typically. And we treat them the way that – the way that we do by bringing in our best practices from the
entire Cushman brain to their experience. So, what we're finding now is there's a real shift, large or small, in the
GOS business in particular, to clients that really want to be given advice on areas such as ESG and workplace
solutions. And you've got to be scale to do it and you've got to be agile to do it as well.

Operator: The next question comes from Michael Griffin with Citi. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael A. Griffin
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.

Q

Great. Thanks. I wanted to talk first about the leasing business, particularly on office. It seems like you're seeing
on the ground there is probably a little bit better than the negative headlines, we've seen out there. I just want to
get some clarity. Is the – are the deals in your pipeline mainly geared toward that kind of Class A trophy product?
Or was that increase indicative of kind of all quality of office being leased, including B and C commodity product?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michelle M. MacKay
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

A

So, I would say that in Q4 of last year, it was largely – larger leases being cut in higher quality buildings. Now,
we're starting to see a mix and a combination of those same leases. So we're starting to see a mix in of smaller
tenants still in high quality buildings, [indiscernible] (00:17:11) but smaller leases in the first quarter of this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael A. Griffin
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.

Q

Got you. That's helpful. And then, maybe just on the cost savings initiatives. I think you still had kind of some of
that flowing into the first quarter. Can you say you're balancing those initiatives relative to other increased costs?
But if we think that the capital markets business is going to improve materially in the back half of the year,
wouldn't you want to be staffing up and then increasing head count kind of in anticipation of that?

29-Apr-2024

Neil O. Johnston

A

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

So, Michael, you raised a great point and that's exactly right. All of our or primarily the majority of our cost savings
are run rate savings that were incurred as we rolled out our cost savings program last year. Essentially, we have
not announced any new cost savings programs for 2024. Of course, we remain nimble. We always are looking for
ways to become more efficient. But essentially the $30 million of cost savings that I referred to is primarily the
result of the actions we took last year. As we look to the back half of the year, we are very focused on growth and
making sure that we are well positioned both on the advisory side and then also on the Services side as we grow
that business in the back half of the year.

Operator: The next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Alex Kramm
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC

Q

Yes. Hey, good evening, everyone. Just quickly, I guess on the capital markets business. I mean, obviously good
stability in the first quarter. Great to see. But your tone on the second quarter, obviously, a little bit more choppy.
So given that seasonally, the second quarter is usually better, did you – do you feel like this year could look a little
bit worse maybe than the first quarter? Again, any visibility specifically on to 2Q would be great.
And then, related to that, you seem as confident as you were a quarter ago about the second half recovery.
Obviously, a lot of things have changed. So, maybe just want to make sure I heard that right or if you do think
there's a higher level of uncertainty from here and if you are reacting to that at all.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michelle M. MacKay
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

A

Sure. I'm very bullish for the recovery and that point of view hasn't changed. But the current outlook is for some
short-term pullback in capital markets. As the mood of the market has changed significantly in the last couple of
weeks, I think we've all witnessed the volatility there. But as you know, that we can swing to the positive on a
couple of key pieces of data or as the market digests data. But like let's not lose the plot line here calling what
happens next quarters might be interesting, but our long-term view, which is how we work and how we think is for
a strong market recovery.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Alex Kramm
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC

Q

Okay. Fair enough. And then, maybe very big picture just – since, we're here like – you, obviously for the last two
quarters have talked about your strategic review. And I think you've looked at all, all the different kind of
businesses. So, I know that that stuff never gets finished. But do you feel like you've essentially completed the
biggest area of focus and anything new that you can share of that review or is that still ongoing?

Michelle M. MacKay

A

Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

No. I think that were – to your point, it's always ongoing. But I think the first quarter performance shows that we're
capable of executing on those priorities and we did what we said we would do and we're going to continue to do
that and be really intentional and opportunistic with it. So, just to reiterate, to strengthen the core, we would just
leverage an interest cost by repricing the term loan and paying down some tax and debt. We continue to operate
with rigor, even though revenue was flat, we improved margin and leasing is growing. We're prioritizing better
services contracts, I made a couple of references to walking away from less accretive deals. And that's an active
way of managing the strategy.
And you're going to continue to see us no matter what the backdrop is here in terms of the economy, take
advantage of every opportunity. So, we're highly activated. I would say we're working differently than we have
historically at a pace unlike what the firm has seen before, with an awareness of exactly where we need to be
focused at all times.

Operator: The next question comes from a Ronald Kamden with Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ronald Kamden
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Q

Hey. Just two quick ones. So, one, starting with the cash flow statement and I sort of appreciate the comments in
the press release It seems like there is certainly a greater focus on free cash flow. It seems like cash from
operations, you said it was not used, but it almost seem like $100 million delta versus a year ago. So, I guess my
question is really, can you talk about what drove such a great performance on the cash flow? How much of that is
one-timers versus something that's sustainable going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil O. Johnston
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

A

Yeah. Great question, Ron. Look, we've been extremely focused on free cash flow and it's starting to really pay
off and you're starting to see it as you say in the results. You're absolutely right. First quarter of this year, this first
quarter a year ago, it was [ph] $95 million (00:22:39) better. So, great performance, primarily driven by working
capital. And so, as we look at that performance, I would say probably about 50% of it is timing and 50% of it is
real actions that we took. So, we're able, for example, in accounts receivable to reduce our DSOs from around 61
days to 59 days – or 58 days, actually. And so, we saw three days of improvement in the quarter. And so feel very
good about free cash flow as we look. We have not given full guidance for the year on free cash flow, but certainly
feel like the start to the year has been a good one.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ronald Kamden
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Q

Great. And then, my second one was just, I remember we talked about deleveraging and the potential for asset
sales and so forth. Any sort of update there? Is that still the plan? How is that going? Thanks.

Operator: The next question comes from Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patrick Mcilwee
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC

Q

Hi. You've got Pat McIlwee on for Stephen today. Thanks for taking my questions. So, first one, I just wanted to
dig in on this a little bit more. I know you've talked about it. But even adjusting for the contract reimbursables, it
looks like service revenue came in a touch light this quarter. I mean, can you just talk bit more about what's
driving this repositioning of the platform? If it has to do with asset turnover at all, if you're seeing any competitive
pressure, or what exactly is driving that? And then how you might expect the rest of the year to play out so you
can achieve that kind of low-single-digit growth guidance here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil O. Johnston
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

A

Sure. Pat, as I think about it, there really are three things driving it. First of all, remember, we did have that
contract change. That accounts for about $25 million in the quarter. So, our Services, overall, instead of being
down 3% would have been flat for the quarter, not where we want them to be, but certainly not declining flat and
certainly that is sort of a baseline.
The second thing is, as you say, we are looking for accretive growth. This is more self-inflicted pain. This is
probably the best way to describe it. We're looking at our contracts. We're looking at our margins. We have found
that the Services we provide, clients are prepared to pay for. So, in certain cases, we've actually [ph] worked
(00:25:21) for contracts, and those clients have actually come back to us and said, no, actually, we did like it to
work. And so, that is us looking at the portfolio and saying, really, we need margins to improve in our Services
business.
And we've also seen that in Europe. We saw Services business in Europe was down. That's where we actually
took a really hard look at our project management business and said, you know what, if contracts are not making
money, and that's a short-term business, so it's much easier to [ph] walk out of (00:25:48) more quickly. And we
said if it's not making, we're not going to do that work. We're going to drive profitable growth, because every bit of
growth takes resources and it's all about capital allocation and reallocation.
And then the third thing in Services is very focused on our GOS global platform. We did have a couple of contract
needs. We're sort of seeing the tail end of that early on in this year. But if you look at the pipeline there, we've
seen very nice strength, and we've had some nice global wins in that business. So very excited about GOS as we
move forward.

Q

Okay. Great. Thanks, Neil. And then just more quickly, so you pushed out your debt maturities to 2030 last year.
So with this capital structure and liquidity that's looking pretty solid at this point, can you just share any thoughts
on what you feel the best use of that liquidity will be, whether it's leaning more towards debt repayment or M&A in
this environment?

Michelle M. MacKay
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

A

Sure. I mean, we're very focused on the allocation of capital, but we need to be making decisions, to your point,
all the time about de-leveraging and growth. And we're going to be doing both, right? And that's what you saw us
do in the first quarter. I'm not going to share any specifics with you on how we're going to be allocating that
capital. But I want you to understand that we're not just having a de-leveraging conversation here, we're having a
growth conversation here and making sure that we're investing enough to put ourselves in the best position to
take advantage of the recovery.

Understood. Thanks, Michelle. Thanks, Neil.

Yeah.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.
Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patrick Joseph O'Shaughnessy
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.

Q

Hey. Good afternoon. So, obviously, rates have moved higher, but I think in concert with that, economic growth
has generally remained resilient and recession fears, at least, for now seem to have abated. To what extent is an
improving growth outlook driving client behavior in Leasing and your Services businesses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michelle M. MacKay
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

A

Yeah. I think that there's – it's interesting, because we're having this conversation with people who are really
focused on the Fed cuts conversation. And even though that's obviously important, solid GDP performance is very
correlated to Leasing decisions, and decisions in our servicing businesses. So, if one prong is not firing, meaning
the Fed is not cutting, we do have the solid GDP prong. And what we're looking forward to is, over the course of
the next year or two, those two firing at the same time. And when they're more connected, you'll start to see much
higher growth rates in Leasing and Capital Markets together.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call

29-Apr-2024

Yeah. Appreciate that. And then, want to touch on project management. So what's your outlook for that as 2024
progresses? And does lease – improving Leasing activity foreshadow improving project management down the
road?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil O. Johnston

A

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

Yeah. I think that's exactly right. We certainly will see an improvement there as usual starts picking up and that
should be [ph] similar in our sales (00:28:58) as we move through the back half of the year.

Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.

Perfect. Thank you.

Operator: The next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Alex Kramm
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC

Q

Yes. Hey. Hello, again. Just a quick follow-up to my earlier Capital Markets question. I mean, I totally hear you on
2Q maybe a little bit softer, but then still confident in the recovery. So, maybe speak to that, maybe I've missed it.
Can you maybe talk about the pipeline a little bit? How that's changed over the last quarter or so to just get a
sense for how the business is building for when we have a better environment? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michelle M. MacKay
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

A

Yeah. I mean the business continues to build. And I was out in one of our offices this past Friday. The Capital
Markets people are really focused and there's a lot of volume in here in terms of pipeline and it's just about
decision-making. So, I would say anything that's been in process is closing. I think anything that would have been
under consideration to start or transacting in the last couple of weeks is probably put on hold for a bit. But I just
want to reiterate, when I say that there's a pause, that pause could be four weeks' long before the market resets
and the tone resets and people really start to move forward again.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Alex Kramm
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC

Q

Okay. Anything in terms of quantitative? Some of your peers sometimes talk about the growth in the pipeline. Any
of that you can share with us or not ready to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil O. Johnston
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

A

Look, Alex, what I can say is that we expect sequentially the second quarter to be bigger than the first quarter. So,
that sort of puts a – almost a floor on what we're thinking about in the second quarter. It's still early in the second
quarter, so really it's difficult to know exactly where it's going to be. But certainly, as Michelle said, pipeline
typically good and sequentially we feel good.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Alex Kramm
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC

Q

Fair enough. I'll follow up. Thanks.
