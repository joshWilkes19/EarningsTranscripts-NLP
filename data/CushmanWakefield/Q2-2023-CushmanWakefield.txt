Megan McGrath 
 
Thank you and welcome to Cushman & Wakefield's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.

 future events.These statements should be considered estimates only, and actual results may differ

During today’s call, we refer to non-GAAP financial measures as outlined by SEC guidelines. 
Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, definitions of non-GAAP financial measures and

Also, please note that throughout the presentation comparisons and growth rates are to the comparable 
periods of 2022 and in local currency unless otherwise stated. 
 
For those of you following along with our presentation, we will begin on Page 4. 
 
With that, I’d like to turn the call over to our CEO, Michelle MacKay. 
 
Michelle MacKay 
 
Thank you, Megan, and thank you everyone for joining us today.  
 
Before I begin, I’d like to thank our former CEO, John Forrester, for his leadership and dedication to this 
company and his assistance in making this transition as seamless as possible.  
 
Neil will dive more deeply into the numbers shortly, but looking at our second quarter, the key takeaway is 
this: In challenging market conditions we were able to quickly pivot and deliver strong financial results with 
sequential improvement in revenue, EBITDA, and margin. 
 
And while I recently took the reins as CEO, I’ve been with the Company for some time and therefore I have 
been able to hit the ground running with the leadership team. I want to thank all of them for their focus and 
hard work since I started, and while we have got plenty of work ahead of us to help the Company achieve 
its full potential, I am very pleased with the start we’ve made and encouraged by what I’m seeing inside the 
business as we take a deeper dive into each of the business lines. 
 
We are already fully underway with a full review of our operations, how we lead our business, and identifying 
our strategic direction, while preserving the integrity and strength of what we’ve already built: a highly 
diversified revenue mix, a resilient business model, and a strong financial position. We’ve great bones here, 
and a clear opportunity to excel.  
 
My goal simply is to significantly improve and build upon Cushman’s already-solid core. As you can imagine, 
I am going to leave no stone unturned in making sure that we move expeditiously and decisively to grow 
this company and build confidence, both in ourselves and also with our partners and key stakeholders. My 
number one priority is ensuring that we are being great stewards of capital, balancing investing for future 
growth and maintaining a healthy balance sheet with a strong liquidity profile.  
 
As a new CEO, I am taking a fresh approach, holistically reviewing our business while introducing a more 
data-driven methodology to the process. This includes a deeper evaluation of free cash flow, margin profile, 
growth expectations, capital intensity and core competencies for each business individually.  
 
Here’s a bit on how we’re already digging in. We’re reinforcing core and expanding our thoughts on growth. 
Over the past several weeks I’ve met with the leaders from each of our businesses to review the businesses’ 
core strengths and better assess how each business line fits into our overall corporate strategy, with a focus 
on identifying new areas of growth and operating efficiencies. I have been extremely impressed with our 
leadership team’s expertise and their cognitive flexibility in reassessing their individual businesses.

Cushman & Wakefield – Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call, July 31, 2023 

  
As we go through this process, we want to foster a solution-oriented entrepreneurial culture that allows us 
to compete and deliver the solve for our clients at the highest level. Markets move quickly, as do the 
demands on our clients, and we need to be able to sprint with them. 
 
Once our strategy is finetuned, we’ll create a framework for decision making based on that refreshed 
strategy. In fact, it’s already in process.  Creating a detailed framework to help internal decision-makers 
make better and faster decisions with a keen focus on our core priorities will be paramount to achieving 
success. We believe that by bringing more data and more information to our leaders in the field in a way 
that is easily digestible, we will create a knowledge-based culture that will encourage decisions being made 
more closely to the business. 
 
How we organize and run the Company will be next on the list. One of our main objectives in this process 
is to simplify our business structure with an eye on strategic value to the Company overall, as well as long-
term return potential. Right size, right structure for all markets.  
 
Today we announced $40 million of additional cost-cutting measures for this year, building upon the $90 
million program we had previously announced. Our assessment has shown that simplifying our structure 
and reducing costs is not only necessary in light of the current market conditions, but also strategically 
advantageous. We see this as an opportunity to create a more streamlined and agile structure for long-
term success. 
 
We must also break down silos in the organization to facilitate and motivate and bring the entire enterprise 
to the table in every client conversation. We don’t want to bring one or two notes; we want to bring the entire 
orchestra. We have truly dominant knowledge and expertise across the Company that we need to bring out 
more definitively to our advantage. Ultimately, leveraging this thought leadership will enable us to be the 
preferred solutions partner to all of our clients and better facilitate cross-selling opportunities across the 
firm. 
 
A refreshed capital allocation framework is the result of all of this work. We recognize that growth is 
important in any industry, and we believe that business resiliency is paramount to ensuring the stability of 
long-term returns. We’ll be taking a more intentional and holistic approach to capital allocation as it relates 
to our updated strategy across all of our businesses with the knowledge that investment capital allocated 
to our business lines is not free and we must evaluate returns accordingly. 
 
Lastly, the health of our balance sheet and our liquidity profile will remain a top priority, and as we finetune 
our strategy we will continue to look to improve our capital structure over time.    
 
Over the upcoming quarters, you’ll hear more from me on the progress of our transformational work at 
Cushman & Wakefield. 
 
But before we move on, I’d like to thank all of our employees for their hard work and dedication during my 
transition into the CEO role, but also every day. Our people are up for the challenges presented by today’s 
market conditions, engaged and always looking to serve our clients.  
 
And now, I’d like to hand the call over to Neil for a review of our second quarter financial results. 
 
Neil Johnston 
 
Thanks Michelle, and good afternoon everyone.

Cushman & Wakefield – Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call, July 31, 2023 

 Second quarter results were in line with our expectations with solid sequential increases in Adjusted 
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin. During the quarter, we maintained our strong focus on free cash 
flow and we will continue to prioritize our balance sheet as we move forward. 
 
Moving on to the details of the quarter, on the top line, revenue trends in the second quarter were similar 
to what we saw during the first quarter. Second quarter Fee Revenue of $1.6 billion declined 14% versus 
the prior year with Capital Markets revenue down 48% and Leasing revenue down 20%. PM/FM revenue 
was up 3% with particular strength in our Property Management and Facilities services businesses. 
Valuation and Other declined 13% in the second quarter as the slowdown in transactions continued to result 
in lower valuation activity. 
 
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of $146 million was down 44% versus prior year, and our second 
quarter Adjusted EBITDA margin was 8.9%, a meaningful improvement from our first quarter margin of 4%.  
 
During the quarter we successfully executed on our cost cutting programs and we were able to more than 
fully offset inflation and prior year investments, realizing $49 million of savings in the first half of the year. 
In addition to our previously announced $90 million program, our teams have worked diligently to identify 
an additional $40 million in gross savings, bringing our expected 2023 in-year cost savings total to $130 
million.  
 
To put these cost savings in perspective, this savings target represents roughly 10% of our annual G&A 
expenses. While our cost out programs are in part a response to today’s operating environment, more 
importantly, they are positioning us to be more efficient and to achieve better long-term margins when 
transactional volumes recover. 
 
Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.22, a decrease of $0.41 cents versus prior year.   
 
Turning to our segment results for the quarter, in the Americas, a year-over-year decline in Brokerage of 
32% was partially offset by continued resiliency in PM/FM, which grew 4%, most notably in property and 
project management. The declines in Brokerage were across most asset types due to the higher interest 
rate environment and macroeconomic headwinds.  
 
EMEA experienced a similar decline in Brokerage to the Americas, while APAC reported flat Brokerage 
trends, an improvement over the past several quarters, as leasing trends in APAC improved, most notably 
in Australia. Our PM/FM business in EMEA and APAC experienced slower performance in the quarter, 
primarily due to lower project management activity.   
 
The Adjusted EBITDA declines in each of our regions were principally driven by the lower Brokerage 
activity, with the Americas also experiencing a lower contribution from Greystone. 
 
Free cash flow for the second quarter was an outflow of $27 million. This compares favorably to the prior 
year, which saw an outflow of $100 million during the same period. Our teams remain highly focused on 
driving cash flow improvements through disciplined working capital management, and I am pleased to 
report that we have generated positive free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis, even during this period 
of lower earnings. 
 
Overall, our financial position remains strong with $1.6 billion of liquidity, consisting of cash-on-hand of 
$502 million, and availability on our revolving credit facility of $1.1 billion. We had no outstanding borrowings 
on our revolver and net leverage was 4.3x at the end of the second quarter. Our debt profile is now more 
than 96% fixed on a net basis. We are focused on our nearer-term maturities and on optimizing our debt 
profile within current market conditions.

Cushman & Wakefield – Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call, July 31, 2023 

 Finally, moving to our outlook, the guidance we provided on our previous earnings call is essentially 
unchanged and we continue to expect full year Adjusted EBITDA margins to be in the range of 9% to 10%. 
Our EBITDA margin guidance is based on the following full year revenue assumptions: Low- to mid-single 
digit revenue growth in PM/FM and approximately 20% revenue declines in Brokerage.  
 
That concludes the financial review. With that, I’ll turn the call back to over to Michelle. 
 
Michelle MacKay 
 
Thanks, Neil.  
 
In summary, our second quarter results were solid, demonstrating the focus of our team and the stability 
and resiliency of our business. Cushman has a strong and stable foundation and a growing platform to build 
upon for the next leg of our growth strategy. As someone who has spent decades in the commercial real 
estate industry, I am confident in our ability to drive sustainable improvements in our business model and 
truly believe in this company’s long-term opportunities. I am energized by the challenge of taking the helm 
and I look forward to working with all of our stakeholders to accelerate our results and capitalize on this 
opportunity. 
 
And with that, Operator, let’s open up the line for Q&A. 
 
Operator 
 
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  
 
(Operator instructions). 
 
The first question comes from Anthony Paolone from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. 
 
Anthony Paolone 
 
Great. Thank you. It looks like a lot of your guidance brackets are pretty comparable to last quarter, but 
Michelle, you had mentioned free cash flow conversion as being one of your focal points. Can you maybe 
just talk about where you see that shaping up for the year at this point and whether there was any change 
on that front? 
 
Michelle MacKay 
 
Yes. I think that we are in a place where we can still move a couple of levers to better our free cash flow 
conversion, including days outstanding, tax and a couple of other levers that we have at our disposal. Our 
goal has always been to reach a range around 30% free cash flow conversion.  
 
Anthony Paolone 
 
Okay. Then just in PM/FM, I think APAC looked like it sequentially kind of dropped; in the quarter it was 
2%. You kept your guidance for the full year for PM/FM. Just wondering how visible that is and if there is 
anything just to note in that business just as we look to the second half.  
 
Neil Johnston 
 
Sure, Tony. The growth rate varies from quarter to quarter in our services business, mainly due to the timing 
of contracts and certain ad hoc work that we perform. In the first quarter in Asia Pacific specifically, we did

 have significant project management work that was short-term in nature, so it boosted that growth in the 
first quarter a little bit. Second quarter was right in line with our full-year assumptions in that low- to mid-
single digit growth range. 
 
So, we still feel very confident in our guide for the full year on services and like the business and its 
resiliency.  
 
Anthony Paolone 
 
Okay. If I could just sneak one more in? Just as we start to think about the fourth quarter, which tends to 
be the biggest quarter, anything you’re seeing in terms of either green shoots or on the flip side particular 
risks to kind of get to the numbers to get you into your guidance brackets? 
 
Michelle MacKay 
 
We’re feeling really good. We’re encouraged by the building pipeline. I mean it’s still too early to call an 
inflection point. There has been a lot of focus on capital markets and recovery in capital markets in 
particular, so we believe it's a question of when, not if. And we all know the capital markets performance is 
highly correlated to interested rates and markets in general, right? And there’s probably one more rate 
move followed a period of no change and then cuts, so we’re directionally feeling particularly good at this 
moment.  
 
Anthony Paolone 
 
Okay. Thank you.  
 
Michelle MacKay 
 
Yes. 
 
Neil Johnston 
 
Thanks, Tony. 
 
Operator 
 
The next question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS. Please go ahead. 
 
Alex Kramm 
 
Hey, good evening everyone. Maybe just starting on the incremental cost cuts. Can you dig a little bit deeper 
in terms of what you’re really attacking here? Then how much of the $40 million incremental is permanent 
versus temporary, or maybe remind us in general where you see permanent versus temporary in the whole 
$130 million now? 
 
Neil Johnston 
 
Sure, Alex. I can take that question.  
 
As we look at the $130 million in total, about 20% of that is temporary, but obviously as we go into next 
year if we don’t see conditions improve, we can always hold out and not let those temporary costs come 
back into the business.

Cushman & Wakefield – Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call, July 31, 2023 

  
We will see $130 million of in-year savings. That’s actually $160 million on a run rate basis, but then of that 
20% is temporary. 
 
In terms of where the savings are, they are primarily infrastructure and overhead costs. As we said, it’s 
roughly 10% of our general and administrative costs, our G&A costs. It includes severance, it includes lease 
terminations, it includes external consulting costs, software costs. It’s really a full-year business, rightsizing 
it for the environment which we’re seeing right now. 
 
Alex Kramm 
 
Great. Then maybe just coming back to the updated guidance, the 20% down in Brokerage, I don’t think 
you gave a number there in the first quarter, so just maybe talk a little bit more broadly how that view has 
changed. I know someone just asked about the fourth quarter and I know there’s a lot of uncertainty there, 
but like how have your overall expectations for the year changed here in Brokerage? 
 
Neil Johnston 
 
You know, they haven’t really changed. As we said in our first call we did see a delay in Brokerage from 
the first quarter to similar results in the second quarter and it came in right in line with what we expected in 
the quarter. 
 
I want to be very specific about our guidance. It’s really focused on the margin being in that 9% to 10% 
range, so we have said that we see that 9% to 10% range given Brokerage at the 20% level. That is currently 
what we’re seeing. Obviously that will change over time, but as I said very focused on margin more than 
giving any form of revenue guidance for the full year.  
 
Alex Kramm 
 
All right, great. Maybe I’ll sneak one more in there as well, a quick one here on the PM/FM margin. I know 
you don’t give specific margins on that business, but we know it’s obviously lowest across the company. 
With some of the cost savings that you have announced here and also the scale you’re still gaining in that 
business, are you actually expanding margins there? Any color how the margins have trended in that 
business line in particular? 
 
Michelle MacKay 
 
Our C&W services businesses in particular has expanded margins over the last five years, but part of the 
margins in some of the other businesses are connected to transaction volumes so they have a base level 
of margin that always delivers for us, but some of the upside in that margin is related to transactions.  
 
Alex Kramm 
 
Right. Fair enough. Thanks guys.  
 
Operator 
 
The next question comes from Doug Harter of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.

Cushman & Wakefield – Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call, July 31, 2023 

 Thanks. You mentioned that you’re starting to see some of the pipeline building for transaction revenue. 
Could you just give a little more detail as to kind of what you’re seeing and kind of what it will take to kind 
of actually get those transactions across the line? 
 
Michelle MacKay 
 
Sure. It’s really compelling and I think that the buildup is from the fact that investors and lenders are trying 
to figure out the market. But as I said a little earlier when I was answering Tony, because we probably have 
one more rate move in the pipeline here, we think that there is going to be a thawing of capital markets late 
this year into early next year, and at that point then it’s just a discussion around how the dam breaks, if you 
will. If it breaks in small pieces or breaks all at once.  
 
Doug Harter 
 
Great. I guess just with the cost cuts that you’ve undertaken, kind of how do you think about your ability to 
benefit from that dam breaking? 
 
Michelle MacKay 
 
Yes. Look, it’s always discretion, what you cost cut and what you keep in. We were very focused on ensuring 
that we would be able to take advantage of the recovery in the markets when we went through this process.  
 
Doug Harter 
 
Great. Thank you.  
 
Operator 
 
The next question comes from Michael Griffin of Citi. Please go ahead. 
 
Michael Griffin 
 
Great, thanks. Michelle, you talked in your opening remarks about looking at your returns accordingly 
across business lines. Are there any business lines in particular that screen as more attractive to invest in 
now? And any color you can give around that would be helpful. 
 
Michelle MacKay 
 
Okay. We just started the process in earnest and we’re going to take our time to complete it well, so in order 
to really answer your question in depth we need some time here because we’re going to do a deep dive 
and a heavy scrub down. But what I can tell you is there are some trends in general that stick out to me 
and they play across many of the business lines in the organization; healthcare related trends, data center 
related trends, things along those lines.  
 
Michael Griffin 
 
Great. Thanks. Then you noted in the release the decline in Leasing has been primarily attributed to lower 
office activity. Is that office overall? Is that commodity office? How are you seeing trends in more of that 
Class A trophy product? Anything you can expand on there would be helpful. 
 
Michelle MacKay

Cushman & Wakefield – Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call, July 31, 2023 

 Sure. We had a research piece that came on Bloomberg last week speaking to the year-over-year net 
absorption rates in that Class A space, which in many markets has been positive. What’s interesting for us 
is that most of the conversation in commercial real estate today is around the office sector and we have 
deep history in this space, as you probably know, so the clients are engaging with us as advisors and not 
just deal-doers. That’s the evolutionary path that we want to be on.  
 
But as a reminder, we don’t traditionally work in the bottom 30% of any asset class, so you will find us 
mainly in Class A and Class B product. 
 
Michael Griffin 
 
Great. That’s it for me. Thanks for the time.  
 
Operator 
 
The next question comes from Stephen Sheldon of William Blair. Please go ahead. 
 
Matt Filek 
 
Hey Michelle and Neil, you have Matt Filek on for Stephen Sheldon. Thank you for taking my questions. 
 
Wanted to circle back on the PM/FM segment. Can you walk us through what would drive you to hit either 
the high or low end of the guidance range? Then, how are you thinking about potential growth looking out 
to 2024? 
 
Neil Johnston 
 
Sure. You know, when we look at services, the great thing about service is the fact that it has long contracts, 
it’s resilient and there is a base level of activity which is there year in and year out. What we do see in the 
services business is a certain amount of ad hoc work that comes along with those service contracts. For 
example, during COVID we had COVID cleanings. In the Northeast we will do snow removals, things like 
that. So to hit the high end of the services range we would expect to see a significant amount of ad hoc 
work. We don’t plan for that but certainly that is something that would drive us to the high end. 
 
Michelle MacKay 
 
Yes. And on the growth front we have continued to make investments in our services businesses, so would 
assume that we are going to have solid growth going into 2024, but as you can imagine this will be part of 
the evaluation process that we’re going through with the strategy refresh. 
 
Matt Filek 
 
Got it. That’s helpful color. Thank you for that. Then to clarify on Brokerage, does the Brokerage guidance 
assume any pickup in transaction volumes from an improving macro? 
 
Neil Johnston 
 
We don’t see a meaningful recovery in the fourth quarter. We do see sequential improvement as we move 
through Q3 into Q4. Q4 is naturally a very big quarter because of the annual nature of the business, but 
our guidance doesn’t contemplate any fast recovery in the market.

Cushman & Wakefield – Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call, July 31, 2023 

  
Got it. Thank you. Then one more for me. What does broker retention look like given the persistently 
challenging market conditions? Do you feel well staffed for a faster-than-expected market recovery if that 
were to occur? 
 
Michelle MacKay 
 
Yes. I think that we are in a particularly educated seat when it comes to broker retention. I know there are 
some headlines out there, mostly negative, that have picked up a bit more traction than the actual facts. If 
we have an individual or group that’s been working for us, we have somewhere between 5 to 10 years of 
financial history on that individual or team, and we know if they are enterprise positive or negative. So, we 
have perfect information when we make a decision about who to offer retention to and who not to offer 
retention to. 
 
We also have a bit of a mix shift happening in the organization over the last five years and so people with 
certain skill sets become more or less valuable over that period of time. We are very much focused on 
retaining those individuals that will be part of future growth of the organization.  
 
Matt Filek 
 
All right. That’s helpful. Thank you both. I’ll jump back in the queue.  
 
Operator 
 
The next question comes from Ronald Camden of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.  
 
Ronald Camden 
 
Hey, two quick questions from me. Thank you for the guidance updates. I thought the incrementals were 
really helpful.  
 
The first one is just on the 9% to 10% EBITDA margin that you reiterated, you talked about the $130 million 
updated targets for cost cutting and $160 million if it’s annualized. Is there a way to sort of break out how 
much that cost cut is contributing to the margin guidance? The reason I ask is, as all else equal, as those 
costs annualize do they become a tailwind for margins in ’24 is where I’m trying to get to.  
 
Neil Johnston 
 
Yes, Ron. The $130 million is already contemplated in our guidance. As we said on our first quarter earnings 
call, we had already actioned $90 million and there were more actions in the pipeline. We really are just 
giving the numbers on this call, the additional $40 million to get to the $130 million.  
 
While the cost guidance doesn’t drive anything above our range this year, it does make us more efficient. 
So, depending on the timing of the brokerage recovery and the extent of that recovery, as Brokerage comes 
back, we will see higher margins that we saw before the efficiency moves.

Helpful. Then just following up on the cash conversion question on the EBITDA, I’m looking at the cash flow 
statement and still I think $238 million down in the first quarter. Maybe can you talk to accrued compensation 
was negative again this quarter, but can you talk to what is one-time or what’s seasonal? I’m just trying to

Cushman & Wakefield – Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call, July 31, 2023 

 get my arms around sort of the working capital in the first half of this year, trying to understand how that’s 
going to trend for the rest.  
 
Neil Johnston 
 
If we look at working capital in the first half of the year, it was driven primarily by the fact that we were 
paying out bonus and commissions from last year at a higher level than we are accruing this year, so that 
causes a little bit of timing.  
 
I think what you’re really trying to get to is what’s the cash conversion for the full year, and I would encourage 
you to look over a period of time. If you look on a trailing 12-month basis our free cash flow basically was 
neutral during the downcycle, and then we’ll see that grow as Brokerage comes back at that high margin. 
So the extent of our free cash flow and cash flow conversion will depend on the timing and the significance 
of the Brokerage recovery as we move through the end of this year into 2024.

The next question comes from Patrick O’Shaughnessy of Raymond James. Please go ahead.  
 
Patrick O’Shaughnessy 
 
Hey, good afternoon. As you conduct your strategic review and you identify incremental growth 
opportunities, would you expect that capitalizing on those opportunities could require incremental company 
capital? 
 
Michelle MacKay 
 
Yes. I would anticipate that there are scenarios where we need incremental capital, but given our cash 
position I think we are in a particularly strong position to use our own cash. 
 
Patrick O’Shaughnessy 
 
Got it. Okay, thank you. Then the earnings release today mentioned an $11 million servicing liability fee in 
connection with amending and extending the account receivable securitization. Neil, maybe you can just 
walk through kind of what is the value of that account receivable securitization program to Cushman & 
Wakefield, and what was the nature of the charge today? 
 
Neil Johnston 
 
Sure. That AR securitization facility basically renews itself every couple of years. This was just a normal 
renewal of the program. It provides us $200 million of basically think of it like a revolver whereby we use 
that AR securitization facility to manage working capital through the first half of the year, and then we repay 
it in the back half of the year, and then the following year again we just use it to manage the seasonal nature 
of the business.
