Q4 2024 Earnings Call

20-Feb-2025

Michelle M. MacKay
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

Thank you, Megan, and good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us today. We concluded 2024 with
unparalleled momentum, reporting our highest Capital Markets revenue growth since the first quarter of 2022 and
another robust quarter of Leasing growth.
Our Services business is now solidified and invigorated, poised to reaccelerate and further supported by
investments going into the platform this year.
2024 produced one of the highest free cash flow conversion percentages in the history of the company, and that
positions us well to pursue top-tier talent, invest in our Services business, and execute on our growth plan
inclusive of M&A. We developed a strategy that includes a commitment to delivering progressively improving
earnings growth over the next several years.
As of now, the macroeconomic environment as it pertains to property is largely favorable. The economy is
growing, creating jobs. Corporate profits are healthy. Odds of a recession have receded. All of these factors have
created a healthy backdrop for Leasing. And our own performance confirms that Leasing has momentum as we
have now had five straight consecutive quarters of year-over-year Leasing revenue growth.
For Capital Markets, we are observing early stages of a recovery. For two years, the market was largely
recalibrating to higher interest rates. That was the hardest part. But now we are largely pasted that. Property
values have corrected. Central banks have begun reducing rates. Debt costs and availability of debt have
improved because lenders are sensing the inflection. And buyers and sellers are proving that they can do deals in
this environment as evidenced by our Q4 performance.
For our 2025 outlook, we expect Leasing revenue growth to remain solid. We continue to observe green shoots in
office. Return to office is gaining momentum. Net absorption is improving, and nearly half of the markets that we
track registered positive absorption in Q4 and a healthy pipeline of expiring leases will create steady deal flow.
Industrial is normalizing, but its growth engines of e-commerce, consumer spending, third-party logistics, and
supply chain optimization remain strong.
In Capital Markets, we are not calling for a hockey-stick recovery because interest rates will more than likely
remain high in this cycle. The Fed funds rate isn't likely going to be zero again, and the 10-year yield isn't going to
be too [indiscernible] (00:08:22). So, we won't get the frenzied activity that we did coming out of COVID. But
based on what we're observing and if current trends hold, we will likely get a good bounce in 2025 as confidence
in our sector continues to grow.
We believe that we are in the early innings of a multi-year upcycle in commercial real estate. And so, we are
accelerating investments across our platform in 2025. This cyclical uplift combined with the work that we are
doing to accelerate profitable growth and our continued commitment to improving our balance sheet makes this
an exciting time to be at Cushman & Wakefield. I want to thank our teams across the globe for an exceptional
2024 and for driving us forward with our new vision: to be known as the premium brand in the industry and to set
the standard across the built environment, from problem solving through exceptional advice and execution of
services.
Now, let me hand the call over to Neil to review our financial performance.

Neil O. Johnston
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

Thanks, Michelle, and good morning, everyone. In 2024, we achieved our financial objectives of improving free
cash flow, protecting margins, and fortifying our balance sheet. We strengthened our financial foundation to lay
the groundwork for sustainable long-term growth.
For the full year, fee revenue of $6.6 billion was up 1%, and adjusted EBITDA expanded 3% to $582 million. Our
EBITDA margin improved by 10 basis points to 8.8%. Adjusted EPS was $0.91, up 8% from last year, setting the
base for future growth.
We delivered $167 million of free cash flow for the year, $66 million higher than 2023, and improved conversion
as a percentage of adjusted net income to 79%. Our strong cash flow enabled us to pay $200 million of our 2025
term loan ahead of schedule. We also lowered our borrowing costs through four term loan repricings over the past
year.
We closed the year with $793 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1.9 billion in total liquidity. Our leverage
ratio improved to 3.8 times from 4.3 times at the end of 2023.
Before providing our 2025 outlook, I'll give some details on our quarterly results. 4Q fee revenue of $1.9 billion
increased by 4%, building on the momentum we drove in the third quarter. Underlying the 14% growth in
brokerage revenues, Capital Markets revenue was up 36% globally, exceeding our guidance as the environment
for transactions continued to strengthen. And our Leasing business delivered another strong quarter, up 7%.
Adjusted EBITDA of $222 million increased 6% as the double-digit improvement in brokerage revenue was
balanced against the ramp-up in growth investments we discussed last quarter and a $7.5 million decrease in
earnings from equity method investments. For the full year, earnings from equity method investments declined
$21 million, primarily attributable to reduced transaction volumes in our Greystone joint venture driven by tighter
lending conditions in 2024.
Moving to service line performance for the quarter, beginning with Leasing. Americas leasing remains a key area
of strength, growing 12% in Q4, the second straight quarter of double-digit growth. Demand was solid across deal
sizes and asset classes, particularly in office as tenants continue to seek out high-quality spaces. We expect
continued strength in 2025, supported by a resilient US economy and increased return-to-office trends. APAC
leasing was stable in Q4 with strong results in Australia and India, offsetting challenges in China. Our strong
market positioning in India positions us to benefit from the country's rapid economic growth, expected to be
among the highest globally over the next decade. Lastly, EMEA leasing contracted 15% in Q4 due to a tough
comparison against last year's 13% growth.
Capital Markets rebounded strongly in Q4. Americas capital markets revenue rose 33%, fueled by industrial deals
and strong office activity. EMEA increased 20% led by France and Eastern Europe. APAC improved 92%, driven
by Japan and Australia, reflecting the benefits of our investments in the region.
In Services, while 2024 was a year of restructuring focused on improving margins and setting up future profitable
growth, fourth quarter service revenues grew 1%, excluding the impact of the non-core divestiture earlier in the
year. Americas services revenue increased 3% in Q4, excluding the divestiture, driven by property management
and facilities management. APAC services declined 7% due to prior-year onetime project revenue, but ended the
year up 3%. EMEA services returned to growth in the fourth quarter, rising 1% as we completed margin

improvement transitions and refocused on growth, especially in design and build. Our Services platform is a key
investment focus in 2025.
Moving now to our outlook. We enter 2025 with a stronger capital structure, lower interest expense, solid cash
reserves, and clear capital allocation priorities. Last year, we outlined our plan to increase investment spending
while continuing to delever over time. Strong Q4 results and positive market conditions reinforced our confidence
that transaction volumes have stabilized, making this the right time for long-term investments.
For 2025, we aim to accelerate Services growth, targeting a run rate of mid-single-digit, top-line growth by midyear with steady progress throughout the year. We expect Leasing growth to remain strong in the mid-single-digit
range, supported by resilient global economies and durable secular tailwinds in office and industrial. We expect
full-year Capital Markets growth to accelerate in 2025 from the mid-single-digit rate we reported for the full year
2024, with the magnitude of the acceleration dependent on interest rates volatility, investor sentiment and
continuing availability of capital.
On the cost front, we will carefully balance increased investment spend with a focus on long-term returns and
value creation. As we have previously stated, we anticipate our incremental investments to be a near-term
headwind to margin improvements, especially in seasonally lower volume quarters. As a result, we expect first
quarter margin to be relatively flat versus the prior year.
In closing, we are pleased with our strong quarterly performance and remain confident in our financial plan. We
expect to achieve improved earnings per share growth in 2025 compared to 2024, driven by our core business
strength and disciplined execution. The investments we are making now will fuel sustainable growth with even
stronger earnings growth anticipated in 2026 and 2027, delivering greater value for our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Michelle.

Michelle M. MacKay
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

Thank you, Neil. In speaking to capital allocation, our investment and growth strategy is a multifaceted, layered
approach, aimed at driving steady expansion in EPS. Each layer of growth builds and complements the other.
Layer one is talent. As we stated in last quarter's call, we have seen significant increase in top-tier talent retention
over the past year due to intentional actions that we've taken to retain our best and brightest. Additionally, you can
also see publicly that we're recruiting significant new talent to the firm, and this process has been ongoing in
earnest since the fall. For example, Miles Treaster, our new Head of US Capital Markets, has already brought in
10 new capital markets team in the past four months alone.
Layer two is funding steady organic expansion. This is work that is deliberate, gradual, and achieved through
internal efforts rather than external acquisitions or major investments. It reflects our focus on leveraging our
existing platform by improving efficiency, nurturing customer relationships, and enhancing core competencies
over time. Due to our scale and global footprint, we have considerable opportunity here to expand within what we
already have.
And layer three is strategic tuck-in growth. This is an ongoing commitment to small-scale acquisitions that
complement the core business or expands us into closely related areas, targeting steady and synergistic growth.
We are looking at acquisitions that have low integration risk with appropriate reliance on cost synergies to achieve
underwriting goals. Within each growth layer, we are already actioning multiple options, and we'll continue to add

to the pipeline in 2025. We believe this plan provides the pillars for attainable, accretive, and progressive longterm growth.
Let me now hand back the call to the operator for questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes
from Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Stephen Sheldon
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC

Q

Hey. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. First, I guess, is there any rough framework you can
provide for how we should be thinking about margins for the full year 2025? I appreciate the commentary that
margins will be flat year-over-year in the first quarter, but it just seems like there are a lot of moving pieces this
year between reinvestments across the business and some of the initiatives that, Michelle, you talked about and
then, clearly, assumptions on the transactional uplift, given the high incremental margins are. So, any rough
frameworks for how we should be thinking about margins full year would be helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michelle M. MacKay
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

A

Thanks for the question, Stephen. Yes, to your point, we are going to have some pressure on margin, given the
amount of investments that we're going to be making over the course of the year that are in the best long-term
interest of the company and its performance. But let me have Neil give you a little more guidance around that for
clarity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil O. Johnston
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

A

Yes, sure, Stephen. So, what we've given you is a framework around how we're thinking about revenue. And then
what we're going to do is balance investment spend with our growth. As always, we see about 45% of our
revenue in the first half with 55% in the second half. So, the first quarter margin guide, that is our smallest quarter
and that's why you're seeing the flat margins there.
What we committed to as a management team in 2025 is really delivering accelerating earnings growth, not just
this year, but in the following years. So, we expect at a minimum to outpace the 2024's 8% EPS growth. And we'll
really balance investment depending on what we see primarily of Capital Markets during the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Stephen Sheldon
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC

Q

Okay. Got it. And maybe just on that, I think with the commentary, you're expecting acceleration versus 2024 in
Capital Markets. Can you just talk some about what you're seeing in the pipeline? And then, any color on how
activity has maybe fared in the first six, seven weeks or so of 2025? I guess, has the fourth quarter momentum
continued at least into the early part of the year?

Q4 2024 Earnings Call

20-Feb-2025

Michelle M. MacKay

A

Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

We saw a bit of a pause in January in our execution. Pipeline is really strong. But specific to us, what we're
starting to see is more of the institutional investor coming to us. And we recently executed on the $950 million
financing, which I would say is probably one of the larger deals that we've done in the history of the company. So,
we're seeing a shift in the makeup, in the composition of our pipeline in particular, which we have a lot of strength
in the middle market and capital markets, which people tend not to talk about as much. But now we're starting to
see a stronger mix into that institutional player as we work on and invest in our institutional capital markets
platform.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Stephen Sheldon

A

Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC

Got it. Yeah, that's great to hear. That's exciting. Maybe just one quick – last quick one just in Services.
Appreciate the commentary about getting mid – to mid-single-digit growth by mid-year. I guess, how should we
think about growth in the first half then? With what you're seeing, would it be fair to think you'd be flat to low-single
digits first half? Just any color on what the Services trajectory could look like to get back to that mid-single digits
by mid-year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil O. Johnston

A

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

Sure, Stephen. Yeah. When you think about our Services business, it'll be a story of sort of gradual improvement
as we go through the year. What we are committed to is getting back to that mid-single-digit growth rate by midyear, and certainly, for the back half of the year. We're starting to see some good progress, but it's slow. 80% of
our Services business comes from sort of recurring contracts, starting to see some nice wins, which will certainly
help the back half of the year, especially in our Global Occupier Services business and in our Property
Management business. But 20% is Project Management. And so, that's the part where once we start seeing
momentum, that'll pick up quite quickly but it will take a [ph] while (00:22:51).
In EMEA, we have finished a lot of the reconfiguration, so expect stronger growth there. APAC is certainly a very
strong services market. And in the Americas, you saw that both in our Facility Services business and in our
Property Management business, both of those returned to growth in the fourth quarter. So, expect some good
things there.

All right. Good to hear. Thank you.

Operator: The next question comes from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

Anthony Paolone
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Q

Thank you and good morning. First question is on the Leasing outlook where you said mid-single-digits growth.
And I was wondering if you can give us a little bit more detail and thoughts around where you see it stronger or
weaker, both by property type and perhaps geography.

A

Okay, let me – good morning, Tony. Let me give you a little context around what we're seeing in the office leasing.
And we'll talk about markets after that. In office, [ph] new absorption (00:23:54) is improving and Q4 was one of
the strongest quarters of demand since the pandemic. Nearly half of the market markets we tracked registered
positive absorption. And an important data point is that sublease space has peaked and is trending lower,
indicating businesses are taking back space and using it again. The return to office is quite clearly trending
higher, [ph] with some (00:24:20) companies mandating three, four, five days a week is growing. But, anyway, it's
absolutely trending to more in-office attendance. And the quality bias remains high, which means higher rents.
In industrial, it's still normalizing from record demand coming out of the pandemic, but it's still healthy. Net
absorption there is still positive. Vacancy is going a bit higher. But in some ways, that's okay because during the
pandemic and post the pandemic, there were 15% to 20% rent growth rates that were not sustainable. And the
market on whole and industrial logistics needed more space options. But those long-term engines remain strong.
As I mentioned in my script, e-commerce, consumer spending on good, population growth and onshoring.
And then if we reflect on the secular markets where we saw strength in net absorption over the course of the year,
Brooklyn, New York is a standout. Tampa is a standout. Baltimore is a standout. Nashville is a standout. In other
areas of the country, in the US in particular, where there's still making progress and absorption, it's obviously San
Francisco, Dallas, DC. These are all examples of really strong historical markets that still need to do a bit more in
terms of absorbing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Anthony Paolone
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Q

Great. Thank you. And then, my second question relates to the investments you're making into the business and
the recruiting efforts. It is pretty noticeable from the outside to see what you've all been doing. And you mentioned
just the investments creating some margin headwinds. So, I was wondering if you could just talk about how it
works. Like is it that you give new recruits higher splits or guarantees? Just wondering what creates the margin
headwind when you go out and add producers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michelle M. MacKay
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

A

Understood. It's not quite that narrow, Tony, because we're investing in the three buckets that I outlined in the
script, talent being one of them. But when we talk about investments in our organic growth to increase market
share in sectors or geos, to capture more market, to improve client retention and build infrastructure, that's what
we're talking about putting some pressure directly on margins.

Okay. Understand. Thank you.

You're on the queue – question queue.

Julien Blouin

A

Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Julien Blouin
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC

Q

Okay. Great. On the industrial front, I wanted to dig into some of those comments. I was wondering, is there any
signs maybe from occupiers or buyers of sort of taking a step back to assess trade policy uncertainty before
making decisions? I'm just sort of wondering if that's been part of the slower execution year-to-date you sort of
noted on the Capital Markets side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michelle M. MacKay
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

A

Specifically, Julien – and welcome, Julien. I believe this is your first call with us. Really, in terms of industrial, it's
too early to draw any definitive conclusions. The policy situation remains fluid and unpredictable, and we're
studying it. Our clients are studying it. But there's a lot we don't know in terms of precise timing and scope of
things like tariffs and how policy is going to change and how it will impact property.
Having said that on the whole, property is proven throughout history in many administrations that it can navigate
these changes. And, importantly, as we're a global business, policy changes that negatively impact one market
can positively impact another. And remember that in terms of our own position through all of this, we're an
advisory business. In times of uncertainty, people need solutions, which means they're bringing us in to help
solve. That could mean expansion, contraction, buildout, relocation, any of these things.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Julien Blouin
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC

Q

Got it. That's very helpful. And maybe touching on sort of the strength, the really impressive strength you saw in
the Capital Markets business in the fourth quarter, maybe specifically looking at APAC, you noted strength in
Japan and Australia. I just want to get a sense of how sustainable you feel those – the sort of trends that we saw
in the fourth quarter could be sort of going into 2025?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michelle M. MacKay
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

A

Yeah. Those are very strong markets for us, but also because they were markets where we made investments in
late 2022. And so, we're seeing the fruits of our labor with regard to those markets in particular, bringing in Capital
Markets expertise.

Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC

Okay. Great. Thank you so much.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Michael Griffin with Citi. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael A. Griffin
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.

Q

Great. Thanks. Michelle, I want to go back to your comments just around transaction activity and expectation for
the year. Obviously, it seems like we're in this higher for longer rate environment. It doesn't seem like the Fed's
going to cut this year, at least as it stands right now. So, as you think about the outlook, what is the catalyst for
incremental transaction activity? Is it debt maturity driven? Are sellers finally capitulating on price? What's going to
get that engine to start picking back up?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michelle M. MacKay
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

A

Okay. I'm going to give you our perspective and our thesis around this. We've been projecting and continue to
project that the stage is being set for steady expansion in Capital Markets activity. And, frankly, that is a healthier
path for the market than the originally anticipated hockey stick recovery. And let me give you some data around
your question and in support of that thesis, what we see is that cap rates have largely recalibrated, which means
that leverage is neutral to positive on most assets, which means the levered player can come back into the capital
markets world. CBD office fixed rate borrowing on average is around 7%, but the cap is around 8.25%. Industrial
is averaging around 6.5% on cap rate basis, mid- to high 5s on financing cost. Multifamily remains neutral, cap
rates and borrowing cost, and there's still a lot of work to do in that particular sector.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael A. Griffin
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.

Q

Great. That's some helpful context. And then maybe just one kind of following up on the theme within office,
clearly, Leasing has continued to improve there. I think the general understanding is that's mainly for kind of the
top-tier, higher-quality buildings. But in markets that continue to show strength, maybe like New York as an
example, have you started to see a spillover effect into maybe lower tier, lower price point buildings that are
seeing incremental leasing demand as a result of kind of the market's improvement?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michelle M. MacKay
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

A

Yeah, you're spot on with that one. The quality basis remains. High-quality office remains in high demand, and
there's not enough of it. And the construction pipeline over the past several years has been lean, the lowest in
over a decade. So, the new space is leased up pretty much and the demand is trickling down to the next best
thing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael A. Griffin
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.

Q

Great. That's it for me. Thanks for the time.
