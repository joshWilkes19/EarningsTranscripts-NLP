Michelle M. MacKay
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

Thank you, Megan. It's hard to believe this is just my third earnings call as CEO of Cushman & Wakefield, given
the pace of change since I became the CEO in July of last year. Since then, we've looked at every aspect of our
business. We have updated and mapped out long-term strategic plans for the first time since the IPO in 2018 and
we're using data to make tough decisions around spending and capital allocation, which will set us all up for future
growth. And we took action toward deleveraging with our two refinancing transactions last year and we plan to
begin the process of reducing our leverage later this quarter.
You can see the impact of the changes that we've made in our 2023 results. We've generated $570 million in
adjusted EBITDA and $100 million of free cash flow, up from essentially a breakeven number in 2022. And we're
not done. We made extraordinary strides last year in a short period of time, operating with rigor, executing with
speed and urgency and never settling, continuing to drive the business forward. And we haven't come this far to
stop now. Every day, we are working to improve our financial position and flexibility and to create momentum both
internally and with our clients so that we are poised to capitalize when the market inevitably rebounds.
We've already started to see some green shoots. In the fourth quarter, leasing revenue grew year-over-year in all
three of our reported regions due to growth in large office and industrial deals in the US and strength in Europe
and APAC. Our services businesses remained resilient, growing revenues at 3% in 2023, on top of double-digit
growth in 2022. But as I've mentioned before, we are not satisfied with this level of growth. But thanks to the
detailed strategy work we completed last year, we're entering 2024 with a better understanding of each of our
services, businesses and a clear focus on strengthening both long-term growth and profitability.
Now, people have been asking about our view on 2024. Let me start with capital markets. As a longtime real
estate investor, I know it's not only the absolute level of interest rates that matter, although it's important. But what
also matters is the shape of the yield curve. With the inverted curve that we have today, people are hesitant to
borrow and lend [ph] long (00:04:08). Once the Fed begins to cut rates, which seems likely to happen later this
year, we expect the yield curve to begin a process of normalizing. This should help people get more comfortable
about taking 5, 10 and 15-year risks, providing a pathway to a more active market. And while we anticipate a
moderate initial reduction in interest rates later this year, we do feel closer to the restarting of capital markets
activity than we have in some time.
So, even before the Fed cuts, there is accretive profitable opportunities for us to pursue. Every week, we hear
about more funds being raised for real estate investment. There is roughly $400 billion of dry powder in the
market waiting to deploy. And even in distress, there's opportunity for Cushman & Wakefield. Our new real estate
optimization team helps our clients evaluate, monitor and address potentially stressed or distressed assets.
Now moving on to leasing. We expect stable to modest growth in this segment in 2024 supported by a solid level
of lease expiration. And even with many companies still permitting hybrid work, there's 10.5 billion square feet of
occupied office space globally. And finally, we see significant opportunities to organically expand our services
businesses, thanks to our global scale and client-centric strategy. We remain disciplined and focused on accretive
growth. For example, we recently won a long-term contract with a large global financial services company. They
weren't looking for the biggest services provider, but for a thoughtful partner to help create and execute innovative
solutions designed specifically for them, which is why they chose Cushman. And in another recent win, the deal
never went to RFP. We won on our reputation, our relationships and our ability to handle complicated situation.
Through our commitment to streamlining our cost structure, enhancing our balance sheet and cash flow, and
strengthening our client facing initiatives, we are poised to create meaningful value as the market returns to
growth.

We will never settle. We're often seen as the scrappy challenger in this market, outthinking others, brave in our
decision making and advice. The people of Cushman & Wakefield proudly lean into today's market challenges
because we don't run away from our clients' biggest challenges, we run to them.
And with that, I'll hand the call over to Neil.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil O. Johnston
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

Thank you, Michelle and good afternoon, everyone. While the macro environment in 2023 was persistently
challenging, we proactively enhanced our balance sheet strength and flexibility, prudently cut costs, and improved
our free cash flow conversion through better working capital efficiency, all of which position us well for a market
recovery.
For the fourth quarter, fee revenue was $1.8 billion, a 3% decrease from the prior year. PM/FM revenue was up
1% or up 3.4%, excluding the contract change we discussed last quarter. This change will continue to impact the
first-half of the year, resulting in a roughly $50 million headwind to fee revenue, but no impact to EBITDA.
Leasing revenues grew 5% versus prior year, the first positive results we have reported in this segment since third
quarter 2022, as we saw improved results in each of our reported regions. Capital markets revenue declined 32%
in the fourth quarter as transactional markets continued to be impacted by interest rate volatility and uncertainty.
Valuation and other was down 4%, a sequential improvement in a year-over-year trend.
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $213 million, down $7 million from the prior year. Despite the decline
in revenue, our adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.8% was essentially flat year-over-year, reflecting our commitment
to cost discipline. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.45, down $0.01 from the prior year.
Turning to our segment results for the quarter. In the Americas, we saw a 10% year-over-year decline in
brokerage revenues with capital markets revenue down 36% and leasing revenue up 2%. We are encouraged by
the fourth quarter performance in leasing as we successfully executed an increased number of large office and
industrial deals. Americas PM/FM revenue increased 1% or 4.6%, excluding the impact of the contract change.
Americas adjusted EBITDA of $139 million, declined 16% or $24 million versus prior year, with $14 million of the
decline attributable to our Greystone joint venture as FHA volumes remained under significant pressure in the
quarter. We continue to believe that long-term fundamentals in the multifamily market are compelling and we
expect results in this business to stabilize in 2024.
EMEA brokerage revenue declined 1% in the quarter, with capital markets down 26% and leasing up 13% with
particular strength in the UK. PM/FM revenue was down 11%, primarily reflecting lower project management
activity due to reduced CapEx budgets as well as our focus on driving profitable growth. Adjusted EBITDA in
EMEA grew 48% with adjusted EBITDA margins up 670 basis points, driven by the change in mix to higher
margin leasing revenue as well as the tighter cost discipline.
Our APAC region reported another solid quarter with leasing revenue up 14% and capital markets up 5%, driven
by strong growth in Southeast Asia and India. Valuation and other was down 4% and PM/FM grew 7% as
property facilities and project management all performed well in the quarter.
Now turning to our full year results. For the full year 2023, we generated fee revenue of $6.5 billion, a 10%
decrease over the prior year. Capital markets declined 41%, leasing was down 12% and valuation and other was

20-Feb-2024

down 11%. Partially offsetting these declines, PM/FM revenue grew 3% for the full year, supported by strong
growth in facilities management and property management. We achieved adjusted EBITDA of $570 million, a
37% decrease from 2022 with adjusted EBITDA margins of 8.7%. Adjusted earnings per share for the year was
$0.84.
Turning to cash flow, we generated $101 million of free cash flow for the full year, compared with a $2 million use
of cash in 2022. I am very proud of our team's work to improve free cash flow generation. It took a global effort
and significant cross-functional cooperation to increase our working capital efficiency and deliver these strong
results. We remain committed to deleveraging and expect to begin debt repayments later this quarter.
Our balance sheet is secure. Following our two refinancings in 2023, we have no significant funded maturity until
2028 outside of $193 million term loan due in 2025, which we expect to repay with cash on hand. At the end of
the quarter, we had $1.9 billion of liquidity, consisting of $800 million of cash on hand and $1.1 billion available on
our revolving credit facility. We had no outstanding borrowings on our revolver. Our net leverage was 4.3 times
and taking into account our interest rate hedges, 93% of our debt is currently fixed rate.
Finally, moving on to our outlook. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be relatively flat year-over-year with
a slight improvement in sequential brokerage trends and modest services revenue growth as we focus on driving
profitable growth in that business. We expect to achieve a slight year-over-year improvement in EBITDA as last
year's cost actions are expected to more than offset first quarter cost increases. We are not providing full year
guidance today, but I'd like to give you some color on how we are currently thinking about the headwinds and
tailwinds for the year. We do expect trends in capital markets to improve throughout 2024, however, sustained
growth is unlikely to occur before the second half of this year when we anticipate a more conducive interest rate
environment. We expect the leasing market to be relatively stable for the year and for our services business to
grow at a similar rate to 2023.
On the costs side, we anticipate some cost pressure in 2024 driven by normal inflation as well as higher incentive
comp as we focus on positioning the company for market growth. We expect these cost headwinds to be mostly
offset by our cost efficiency initiatives.
In conclusion, in 2023, we solidified the balance sheet and significantly improved free cash flow, ending the year
with positive momentum. We are financially well-positioned for growth, margin improvements and further capital
structure enhancements once consistent market growth returns.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Michelle.

Michelle M. MacKay

Thanks, Neil. 2023 was the year that we strengthened our foundation, building on Cushman's 100-plus years of
history to begin writing the story of our next century. 2024 will be another transformational year for us, as we see
future growth opportunities, continue to execute for the long term, drive discipline in our capital allocation and
maintain our focus on unlocking meaningful value in the company.
Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator to take your questions. Operator?

Q4 2023 Earnings Call

20-Feb-2024

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's first
question comes from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Anthony Paolone
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Q

Thank you. I guess, my first one, just I wanted to clarify, Neil, like when you talk about services fee revenue, what
all is included in that bucket because, I guess, what I'm trying to understand is just kind of where the 2024
revenue picture rolls up to just given the three bullets here in your outlook?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil O. Johnston
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

A

Sure, Tony. So essentially three areas; it's property management, facilities management, which – in facilities
management we include our CWS business, which is the more janitorial, and then the project management. And
then finally, project management. If we think about 2023, it was really project management where we saw the
decline, especially in the fourth quarter. Facilities management and property management were strong, but
certainly, as CapEx budgets got constrained during the year, it was the more ad-hoc property management which
declined.
As we look to 2024, particularly in the first quarter, we are hyper focused on accretive long-term growth. And so if
we look at our service contracts which are historically long-term and recurring, what we really are focused on is
how we improve the profitability over the long run. So services remains a key focus area for us. We are focused
on delivering high quality, differentiated service. And so what that may do is pressure the margin certainly early in
the year but ultimately lead to strong accretive growth as we move through the back half of the year and into
2025.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Anthony Paolone
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Q

Okay. But if I just try to take what you've put out here and noting sort of the cost headwinds, some of that you'll
offset. I mean, should we take the outlook to be, if you're running a fairly flattish top-line, that margins will be flat,
maybe even down a little bit? Just trying to get to the sensitivity on margins.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil O. Johnston
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

A

Sure. So if we look at margins, I think we got to break the year into two halves. Obviously, a lot of the margin will
depend on how we see brokerage coming back. As we know, when we see brokerage come back that's when we
really will see the margin accretion. If we think specifically about the first quarter, what we – we do expect to be
able to drive approximately 100 basis points of margin improvement in the first quarter as we see a net benefit of
our 2023 cost savings. And then if we look to the full year, we expect that net benefit to reverse as we lap some of
that 2023 cost action. Taking a look at our longer term view, the work we did on the cost side in 2023 has set us
up well for margin accretion when brokerage comes back, but that'll depend on the speed of the recovery.

Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call

20-Feb-2024

Q

Ronald Kamdem
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Great. So I guess my first question was just on the thinking about sort of the cash flow conversion. Maybe can
you just provide some context of how 2023 closed out in your view and how you're thinking about cash flow
conversion, as we're going into 2024, even if it's a first half or a second half breakdown? Curious how you guys
are thinking about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Neil O. Johnston
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

Sure. Absolutely, Ron. So, as I said on the call, we were exceptionally pleased with the work that our teams did to
drive free cash flow in 2023 and that certainly has positioned us well as we go into 2024 to be able use that
capital in the most accretive manner. Several factors drove the positive outcome but it was primarily working
capital. And if we look at what the contributors were in working capital, about half of it was from the natural
release of working capital as the business slowed. The other half was really driven by our internal [ph] focused
initiatives (00:18:48). So as we look into 2024, it's those initiatives which will really put us in a good place through
2024. I do not expect to see the same level of natural release that we saw in 2023 as the business strengthens.
And in fact, as we – we will continue to focus on free cash flow conversion. It is a very high priority, but you can
expect us to use our balance sheet to drive growth, especially as we start seeing those green shoots in the back
half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q

Ronald Kamdem
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Great. And then just going back to the 1Q outlook, which is super helpful. You talked about sort of a slight
increase in adjusted EBITDA. I think you mentioned sort of 100 basis points and basically margin gains versus
last year. I guess, if we roll that forward a little bit, thinking about the back half of the year, how should we be
thinking about sort of the year-over-year comp on EBITDA, right? Because, presumably there is some sort of
recovery coming in the back half of the year, but it sounds like depending on the margin outlook, EBITDA could
be flat, could be slightly up, like as we roll forward, what should we be keeping in mind for the EBITDA trajectory
compared to 2023? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Neil O. Johnston
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

Yeah. I think, Ron, I think the question you're really asking is on the costs side, how we're thinking about the
costs. We'll make assumptions on the revenue side and I'll leave that to you. We're not providing full guidance.
But as we think about the costs for the full year, we are balancing some headwinds and some tailwinds. As with
most companies, we are facing some inflation, particularly in the first half of the year. And in addition, we will see
some of our incentive comp come back certainly as performance improves. So what that means is we certainly
will offset all of our cost increases in the first half of the year, but as we look to back of the year, we will mostly
offset our increases but not completely. And so margin accretion in the back half will really be driven by that
recovery in brokerage, depending on the timing and extent of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Michael Griffin with Citi. Please go ahead.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call

20-Feb-2024

Great. Thanks. Neil, maybe just a question on the balance sheet and leverage. I know it's still above kind of the
historical range that you're looking to get it in. But if the expectation and maybe I read this wrong, is this for
EBITDA to be flat on a year-over-year basis. I guess, what's it going to take to get that leverage metric down to a
more comfortable level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

A

Neil O. Johnston
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

Michael, look, if we think about 2023, we had a very strong free cash flow year. So that's given us a lot of flexibility
and optionality. As we look at 2024, leverage is clearly a key priority. And as I said on the call, we will begin
repaying debt at the end of the quarter. Our intent is to pay down the $193 million that is out on the 2025 term
loan by August of 2025, but the exact timing will depend on how we see that recovery. We are fairly optimistic
about the year. And so, we will see leverage come down naturally as EBITDA improves. We ended the year at 4.3
times, which was right in line with what we guided to and our long run target remains intact. We would like to
operate in that 2 to 3 times, but naturally leverage is driven by two things debt and EBITDA. And so, as we see
that recovery in EBITDA, that's where we really see the decline in leverage.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael A. Griffin
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.

Q

Got you. Appreciate the color on that. And then maybe just a broader question about the leasing market. It seems
like results in the fourth quarter were better than what expectations were going into it. I mean, are you seeing a
more concerted effort for these occupiers of particularly office real estate to make decisions around leasing? I
mean, we've heard, I guess, more on the REIT side that large occupiers are still kind delayed in making these big
decisions. So, has anything changed there or has the time from first interacting with a broker to sign the lease, is
that still pretty long relative to historical levels?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michelle M. MacKay
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

A

Michael, this is Michelle. Let me unpack that for you. Net-net, leasing is looking really solid for us and it's a global
strength at Cushman & Wakefield. It has been driven by the performance that we've seen, has been driven by
larger office and industrial deals. And if you look at 2023, the average deal size for us did increase in office in

particular, so we are seeing a lot of those larger, more concentrated transactions. And in the US, in particular, we
saw strength in the Northeast markets, the Tri-State, the Midwest; and in Europe, I would call out the UK; and in
APAC, I would call out India. So we're feeling pretty optimistic about leasing going forward in 2024.
To your question about occupiers making decisions, I think the type of occupier that we are dealing with and the
Class A product that we tend to work in, has really driven that kind of performance because those occupiers are
making decisions.

Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Steve Sheldon with William Blair.
Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patrick Mcilwee
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC

Q

Hi. You've got Pat Mcilwee on today. So my first question, it sounds like you're essentially at your targeted run
rate for the cost saving initiatives at this point. I just want to ask if you'd be able to quantify the impact of those
initiatives in the quarter. And if you feel that you're still at an appropriate run rate heading into 2024 or if there are
any areas you're still looking at for additional efficiency?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil O. Johnston
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

A

Yeah. So we are very comfortable where we are for the cost efficiency standpoint. 2023 was the year when we
really reset our cost base. Our target was to take out $130 million of cost, we achieved $140 million. So we feel
good about what we achieved and just very proud of what the teams did throughout the world in achieving those
cost savings.
We are now in a pretty good place. So now we're sort of turning our attention on how we start seeding growth in
the company as we look forward, obviously, depending on what we see happening in the brokerage markets. That
$140 million will have a carryover impact of about $30 million, which we'll see primarily in the first half of the year.
We'll continue to be very prudent on cost. Cost management is clearly a focus and a discipline that we're very
good at over time and we'll continue. At this point, we are not planning any specific cost initiatives like we did in
2023. But at the same time, there are always levers that we could pull, but we are turning our attention more to
seeding growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Patrick Mcilwee
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC

Q

Great. Thanks, Neil. And then just quickly, can you provide any additional color on some of the underlying trends
within PM/FM or services? And, specifically, what exactly is driving some of that weakness you saw? I think you
said it accelerated a bit in the fourth quarter, just what's going on there broadly?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Neil O. Johnston
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cushman & Wakefield Plc

A

Yeah. If you look at services, services performed right in-line with our expectation and our guidance for the full
year. The one adjustment you have to make is for a single large contract, where we changed the way in which we
are accounting for that contract. That's about $50 million in 2023 and about $50 million in 2024. So if you exclude
that contract, which really just changes the way our gross net revenue is reflected but does not change the
EBITDA or the profitability of the contract. We grew our services business at 4% for the year, which was right in
line with our guidance.

We expect similar performance in 2024. If we look at where we saw, essentially it was in the project management
where we saw a slight slowdown, but property management and facilities management were very strong, where
we saw particularly strong growth in Asia-Pacific, where we have large services businesses and those businesses
performed well.
On the project management side and certainly as we look at making the business more efficient, that was really
what drove the decline in services in EMEA, very, very healthy look at the business and really a long term focus,
as I say, to drive long-term accretion. So, as we look in the first and second quarter, we will continue to focus on
profitability and expect to achieve the same level of growth in 2024 as we achieved in 2023.
